    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia _Rodrigo": "Olivia Isabel Rodrigo (born February 20, 2003) is an American singer-songwriter and actress. She gained recognition in the late 2010s with her lead roles on the Disney television programs Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. After signing with Geffen and Interscope Records in 2020, Rodrigo released her debut single \"Drivers License\", which broke various records and became one of the best-selling songs of 2021, propelling her to mainstream fame. She followed it up that year with the singles \"Deja Vu\" and \"Good 4 U\".Rodrigo's debut studio album, Sour (2021), topped charts globally and was met with widespread critical acclaim, earning her a Brit Award and three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. Time named her the 2021 Entertainer of the Year and Billboard named her Woman of the Year in 2022.Olivia Isabel Rodrigo was born on February 20, 2003, at Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta, California.[3][4][5] She lived and grew up in neighboring Temecula.[6] Rodrigo is biracial, with her father being a Filipino-American and her mother having German and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Her father works as a family therapist and her mother works as a school teacher.[7] She has stated that her paternal great-grandfather moved from the Philippines to the United States as a teenager and her family follows Filipino traditions and cuisine.[10] Rodrigo started taking vocal lessons in kindergarten and learned to play piano soon after.[11] She began taking acting and singing classes at age six and started acting in theater productions in elementary school.[5][12] Rodrigo was playing guitar by age 12.[11] She grew up listening to her parents' favorite alternative rock music, such as the bands No Doubt, Pearl Jam, the White Stripes, and Green Day. Rodrigo became interested in songwriting after listening to country music, especially American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.[13] She moved to Los Angeles after landing her role on Bizaardvark.[12]Rodrigo first appeared onscreen in an Old Navy commercial.[14][15] Shortly after in 2015, at age twelve, she made her acting debut portraying the lead role of Grace Thomas in direct-to-video film An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success.[16] In 2016, Rodrigo received recognition for starring as Paige Olvera, a guitarist in the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark,[17][18][19] a role she played for three seasons.[citation needed]In February 2019, she was cast in the starring role of Nini Salazar-Roberts on the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which premiered in November of that year;[20] for the show's soundtrack, Rodrigo wrote \"All I Want\" and co-wrote \"Just for a Moment\" with co-star Joshua Bassett.[21] Rodrigo was praised for her performance,[22][23] with Joel Keller from Decider describing her as \"especially magnetic\".[24]Rodrigo signed with Interscope Records and Geffen Records in 2020. She negotiated the record deal to secure her the ownership of the masters of her music.[7] On January 8, 2021, she released her debut single, \"Drivers License\", which she co-wrote with producer Dan Nigro.[25][26][27] Within the week of its release, \"Drivers License\" was critically acclaimed,[28] and broke Spotify's record twice for most daily streams ever for a non-holiday song with over 15.7\u00a0million global streams on January 11 and over 17 million global streams the next day.[29][30] It went on to break another Spotify record for the first song in history to hit 80 million streams in 7 days.[31] The song debuted at number one on Billboard Hot 100,[32] and reached number-one in numerous other countries.[33][34] Rodrigo stated in an interview that \"It's been the absolute craziest week of my life ... My entire life just, like, shifted in an instant.\"[35]On April 1, 2021, Rodrigo released her follow-up single, \"Deja Vu\", which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100,[36] making her the first artist to debut their first two releases in the top 10 of the Hot 100.[37] The third single preceding her debut album, \"Good 4 U\", followed on May 14, 2021, and became her second single to debut at number one on the Hot 100.[38][39] Sour, her debut studio album, was released on May 21, 2021, to critical acclaim.[40] Charlie Gunn of The Forty-Five called it \"the greatest coming-of-age album since early Taylor Swift or Lorde\".[41] Slate's Chris Molanphy said its first three singles alone established Rodrigo's \"early status as Gen-Z's most versatile new artist\".[42] According to Clash critic Robin Murray, Rodrigo is regarded as one of Generation Z's finest artists,[43] while Variety dubbed her \"the Voice of her Generation\" in its cover story of Rodrigo.[13] Sour debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and spent a total of five weeks at the spot, becoming the longest reigning number-one album by a female artist in 2021.[44]In June 2021, Rodrigo premiered Sour Prom, a prom-themed concert film on YouTube.[45] On December 6, 2021, Rodrigo announced a world tour, including tour stops in the United States, Canada, and Europe.[46] Three days later, she was named Entertainer of the Year by Time.[47] In an Instagram post on December 24, 2021, Rodrigo uploaded a snippet of a Christmas song called \"The Bels\" that she wrote and recorded at age five.[48][49] According to Billboard, Rodrigo closed 2021 as the best-selling singles artist worldwide,[50] placing eight songs on the year-end Global 200 chart, including \"Drivers License\" at number four, \"Good 4 U\" at number nine,  and \"Deja Vu\" at number 27.[51] In the US and UK, Sour was respectively the third and fourth best-selling album of 2021.[52][53] Sour and \"Drivers License\" were also respectively Spotify's most streamed album and song globally.[54] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked Rodrigo as the tenth best selling artist of 2021 and Sour as the second best selling album of 2021.[55]On February 17, 2022, Rodrigo announced and released the trailer of her Disney+ documentary film driving home 2 u (a SOUR film), which was released on March 25, 2022.[56] Rodrigo received seven nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Album of the Year for Sour, and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Drivers License\".[57] She won the awards for Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album for Sour, and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Drivers License\".[58]Rodrigo has been described as a pop,[59] pop rock,[60] teen pop,[61] indie pop,[62] alternative pop,[63] and bubblegum pop artist.[64] She cites Taylor Swift and Lorde as her idols and main musical inspirations,[65] and also dubbed herself Swift's biggest fan \"in the whole world\".[66] Her other influences include Alanis Morissette, Kacey Musgraves,[67] Fiona Apple, St. Vincent,[68] Cardi B,[69] Gwen Stefani[70] and Avril Lavigne.[71] Rodrigo has stated that she wants to be a songwriter and not \"the biggest pop star that ever lived\". She revealed that she chose to sign with Interscope/Geffen Records because its CEO praised her songwriting, not her \"potential star quality\".[7] Music journalist Laura Snapes called Rodrigo a \"flag-bearer\" for a new wave of songwriters who incline towards power ballads \"that are as emotional as ever, but project that emotion inward, trading bombast for hush\", and described her musical style as rooted in heartache, mental health, and sadness, without being melodramatic, expressing more realistic perspectives than resilient.[72] Rodrigo's voice type is identified as soprano.[73][74]On July 13, 2021, Rodrigo was involved in a White House effort to promote COVID-19 vaccinations among young people in the US. She met with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci, to discuss her efforts.[75][76][77] CNN reported that Rodrigo would record videos about the importance of young people getting vaccinated, including answering questions the youth have regarding the vaccination.[75] She became Glossier's first ever celebrity-partner in 2022.[78] Rodrigo is also an institute speaker and panelist for the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media.[79]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Main_Page": "Interstate 196 (I-196) is an auxiliary interstate highway that runs for 80.6 miles (129.7\u00a0km) in the US state of Michigan. It is a state trunkline highway that links Benton Harbor, South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids. I-196 is known as the Gerald R. Ford Freeway in Kent, Ottawa, and Allegan counties, after the 38th president of the United States, who was raised in Grand Rapids and served Michigan in the House of Representatives.  There are two business loops (BL I-196) and one business spur (BS I-196) that serve the South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids areas. The current I-196 is the second in the state to bear the number. The Benton Harbor\u2013Grand Rapids freeway was designated I-96 in the 1950s while another interstate, between Muskegon and Grand Rapids, was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963, which switched the two numbers.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Wikipedia:About": "Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia helping to create a world where everyone can freely share and access all available knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and consists of freely editable content. The name \"Wikipedia\" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning \"quick\") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide readers to related pages with more information.Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers. Anyone with Internet access and in good standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting 1.8 billion unique-device visitors monthly as of April\u00a02022[update]. It currently has more than fifty-eight million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,495,717 articles in English with 124,404 active contributors in the past month.The fundamental principles of Wikipedia are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, with which familiarity is not a requirement for contributing.Anyone is allowed to add or edit words, references, images, and other media here. What is contributed is more important than who contributes it. To remain, the content must be free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people. It should conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable source. Editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research will not remain. Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia, as its software allows easy reversal of errors, and many experienced editors watch to ensure that edits are improvements. Begin by simply clicking the Edit button at the top of any editable page!Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, with articles on new events appearing within minutes rather than months or years. Because everyone can help improve it, it has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to the quantity of its articles, its contributors work on improving their quality, removing and repairing misinformation and other errors. Over time, articles tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. Because anyone can edit them, they may contain undetected misinformation, errors or vandalism. Readers who recognize this can obtain valid information (see Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia) and fix the articles.Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company Bomis. Because Nupedia required highly qualified contributors and had an elaborate peer review system, its content grew slowly. During 2000, Jimmy Wales, Nupedia's founder and Bomis' cofounder, and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed for the project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a wiki could allow public members to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January\u00a010, 2001.There was considerable resistance from Nupedia's editors and reviewers to associate it with a Wiki-format website; so Sanger gave the new project the name \"Wikipedia\", and it was launched on its own wikipedia.com domain on January\u00a015 (now called \"Wikipedia Day\" by some users). Its server (in San Diego) and bandwidth were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on Wikipedia include Tim Shell, one of Bomis' cofounders and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.In May 2001, Wikipedias were launched in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish, and were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian versions. Polish was added In September,[2] and further commitment to Wikipedia's multilingual provision was made. Afrikaans, Norwegian and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced by the end of that year.When the Wikimedia Foundation was launched in 2003, Wikipedia's domain was changed to wikipedia.org, corresponding with its new parent organization's .org top-level domain denoting its not-for-profit nature. There are now Wikipedias in over 300 languages.Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages the inclusion of a tremendous amount of content. About 120,000\u00a0people\u2014from expert scholars to casual readers\u2014regularly edit Wikipedia. These experienced editors help create a consistent style, following our Manual of Style. Contributors are called \"editors\" or \"Wikipedians\", regardless of their experience.Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members maintain civility while carrying out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource. Editors can watch pages, and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to track or rectify bad edits. When there are disagreements on content, editors often work together to compile articles that fairly represent current expert opinion. Aspiring authors may wish to read Contributing to Wikipedia before contributing.Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in Wikipedia's editing or daily operation.Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed in 2003 to fund the two-year old Wikipedia and has since created a family of free-content projects also built and maintained by contributing users.Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike\u00a03.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA) and the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Some text has been imported only under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text is identified either on the page footer, in the page history, or on the article's Talk (discussion) page. Every image has a description page indicating the license under which it is released or, if it is non-free, the rationale under which it is used.Contributions remain their creators' property, while the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses ensure they are freely distributable and reproducible. (See content disclaimer for more information.)Text on Wikipedia is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in that page's history, which is publicly viewable. Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page, which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge. As you read this, dozens of articles are being improved and new articles are being created. Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page, and random pages at Random articles. 6,093\u00a0articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles, exemplifying the encyclopedia's best content. Another 36,305\u00a0are designated as good articles. Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists, the best of which are designated as featured lists. Wikipedia also has portals that organize content around topic areas. You can find articles using the Search Wikipedia box at the upper right of each page (or, if using the Monobook skin, a bit lower along the left-hand side).Wikipedia is available in more than 300 languages, including a Simple English version. Related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, scientific reference sources, a travel guide, a data repository, and a news service (see sister projects). Each is maintained and managed by its own community, and often includes information that is hard to find elsewhere.Wikipedia articles are all cross-referenced. Highlighted text like this means \"click here\" for in-depth information. (Hovering is probably deep enough.) There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, navigational templates, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information on our sister projects. Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing\u2014this is one simple way to contribute.As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus. For a while, others may become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint that can take some time\u2014months or years perhaps\u2014to achieve better-balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive. Additional editors eventually expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. Also, Wikipedia operates several internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called Featured Articles (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second-best tier of articles are designated Good Articles. This process can take months or years to be achieved through editors' concerted effort. Some articles contain statements that have not yet been fully cited. Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source. Individual articles will vary in quality and maturity by their nature. Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add.Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles. It draws from a vast pool of contributors: the whole world. This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static (stays the same) and falls out of date until its next edition. Wikipedia is more dynamic: You don't have to wait for the next edition to come out (there are no editions), as Wikipedia is published online as it is written online. Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in. You can update Wikipedia at any moment. People do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and the latest facts in every subject.Fourth, Wikipedia has a meager \"publishing\" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is online, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution. This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone. This has also enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages simultaneously by people literate in each. Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed. Computers have another environmental cost.Sixth, Wikipedia is extra-linear (more than linear). Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks. Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility. The encyclopedia also has correlated to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten. It is a community effort, with most people involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way. See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses below\u00a0...Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences arise because it is open to anyone. According to editorial guidelines and policies, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus.The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes. Thus information added to Wikipedia never \"vanishes\" irreversibly. Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source, the information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media) and may lead to \"a better sense of how to evaluate information sources.\" [3]Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia, where consensus is to only link them at the end of each article. Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected. Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these to support the view that Wikipedia is unreliable. A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable (including sources such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Associated Press, and the Oxford English Dictionary) can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article, and editors are encouraged to be bold. To get started, the intro tutorial has helpful advice. Also, creating an account offers many benefits. Editors are expected to add only verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions, and to remain civil when discussing issues. Vandals will have their edits reverted and be blocked from editing.Most articles start as stubs, but after many contributions, they can become featured articles. All editors are unpaid volunteers, including administrators, trusted editors who are given elevated permissions. The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing. That makes updating the encyclopedia very quick. Every page has an associated talk page tab, where improvements to it are discussed.As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and various positive systems for continual article review and improvement. Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.Besides, specific types of articles or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes (such as biographical article assessment), and expert reviewers within specific subjects. Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup.Wikipedia uses MediaWiki software, the open-source program used not only on Wikimedia projects but also on many other third-party websites. The hardware supporting the Wikimedia projects is based on several hundred servers in various hosting centers worldwide. Full descriptions of these servers and their roles are available on this Meta-Wiki page. For technical information about Wikipedia, check Technical FAQ. Wikipedia publishes various types of metadata; and, across its pages, are many thousands of microformats.Wikipedia is run as a communal effort. It is a community project whose result is an encyclopedia. Feedback about the content should, in the first instance, be raised on the discussion pages of those articles. Be bold and edit the pages to add information or correct mistakes.The Help:Contents may be accessed by clicking help displayed under the \u25ba\u00a0Interaction\u00a0tab at the top left of all pages.There is an established escalation-and-dispute process within Wikipedia and pages designed for questions, feedback, suggestions, and comments. For a full listing of the services and assistance that can be requested on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Request directory.See also:Facilities to help users researching specific topics can be found at:Because of Wikipedia's nature, it is encouraged that people looking for information should try to find it themselves in the first instance. If information is found to be missing from Wikipedia, please be bold and add it.For a listing of ongoing discussions and current requests, see the dashboard. For specific discussion not related to article content or editor conduct, see the Village pump, which covers such subjects as milestone announcements, policy and technical discussion, and information on other specialized portals such as the help, reference and peer review desks. The Community portal is a centralized place to find things to do, collaborations, and general editing to help information and find out what is happening. The Signpost, a community-edited newspaper, has recent news and opinion regarding Wikipedia, its sister projects, and the Wikimedia Foundation.To contact individual contributors, leave a message on their talk page. Standard places to ask policy and project-related questions are the Village pump, online, and the Wikipedia mailing lists, over e-mail. Reach other Wikipedians via IRC and e-mail.Besides, the Wikimedia Foundation Meta-Wiki is a site for coordinating the various Wikipedia projects and sister projects (and abstract discussions of policy and direction).

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo": "Olivia Isabel Rodrigo (born February 20, 2003) is an American singer-songwriter and actress. She gained recognition in the late 2010s with her lead roles on the Disney television programs Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. After signing with Geffen and Interscope Records in 2020, Rodrigo released her debut single \"Drivers License\", which broke various records and became one of the best-selling songs of 2021, propelling her to mainstream fame. She followed it up that year with the singles \"Deja Vu\" and \"Good 4 U\".Rodrigo's debut studio album, Sour (2021), topped charts globally and was met with widespread critical acclaim, earning her a Brit Award and three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. Time named her the 2021 Entertainer of the Year and Billboard named her Woman of the Year in 2022.Olivia Isabel Rodrigo was born on February 20, 2003, at Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta, California.[3][4][5] She lived and grew up in neighboring Temecula.[6] Rodrigo is biracial, with her father being a Filipino-American and her mother having German and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Her father works as a family therapist and her mother works as a school teacher.[7] She has stated that her paternal great-grandfather moved from the Philippines to the United States as a teenager and her family follows Filipino traditions and cuisine.[10] Rodrigo started taking vocal lessons in kindergarten and learned to play piano soon after.[11] She began taking acting and singing classes at age six and started acting in theater productions in elementary school.[5][12] Rodrigo was playing guitar by age 12.[11] She grew up listening to her parents' favorite alternative rock music, such as the bands No Doubt, Pearl Jam, the White Stripes, and Green Day. Rodrigo became interested in songwriting after listening to country music, especially American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.[13] She moved to Los Angeles after landing her role on Bizaardvark.[12]Rodrigo first appeared onscreen in an Old Navy commercial.[14][15] Shortly after in 2015, at age twelve, she made her acting debut portraying the lead role of Grace Thomas in direct-to-video film An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success.[16] In 2016, Rodrigo received recognition for starring as Paige Olvera, a guitarist in the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark,[17][18][19] a role she played for three seasons.[citation needed]In February 2019, she was cast in the starring role of Nini Salazar-Roberts on the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which premiered in November of that year;[20] for the show's soundtrack, Rodrigo wrote \"All I Want\" and co-wrote \"Just for a Moment\" with co-star Joshua Bassett.[21] Rodrigo was praised for her performance,[22][23] with Joel Keller from Decider describing her as \"especially magnetic\".[24]Rodrigo signed with Interscope Records and Geffen Records in 2020. She negotiated the record deal to secure her the ownership of the masters of her music.[7] On January 8, 2021, she released her debut single, \"Drivers License\", which she co-wrote with producer Dan Nigro.[25][26][27] Within the week of its release, \"Drivers License\" was critically acclaimed,[28] and broke Spotify's record twice for most daily streams ever for a non-holiday song with over 15.7\u00a0million global streams on January 11 and over 17 million global streams the next day.[29][30] It went on to break another Spotify record for the first song in history to hit 80 million streams in 7 days.[31] The song debuted at number one on Billboard Hot 100,[32] and reached number-one in numerous other countries.[33][34] Rodrigo stated in an interview that \"It's been the absolute craziest week of my life ... My entire life just, like, shifted in an instant.\"[35]On April 1, 2021, Rodrigo released her follow-up single, \"Deja Vu\", which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100,[36] making her the first artist to debut their first two releases in the top 10 of the Hot 100.[37] The third single preceding her debut album, \"Good 4 U\", followed on May 14, 2021, and became her second single to debut at number one on the Hot 100.[38][39] Sour, her debut studio album, was released on May 21, 2021, to critical acclaim.[40] Charlie Gunn of The Forty-Five called it \"the greatest coming-of-age album since early Taylor Swift or Lorde\".[41] Slate's Chris Molanphy said its first three singles alone established Rodrigo's \"early status as Gen-Z's most versatile new artist\".[42] According to Clash critic Robin Murray, Rodrigo is regarded as one of Generation Z's finest artists,[43] while Variety dubbed her \"the Voice of her Generation\" in its cover story of Rodrigo.[13] Sour debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and spent a total of five weeks at the spot, becoming the longest reigning number-one album by a female artist in 2021.[44]In June 2021, Rodrigo premiered Sour Prom, a prom-themed concert film on YouTube.[45] On December 6, 2021, Rodrigo announced a world tour, including tour stops in the United States, Canada, and Europe.[46] Three days later, she was named Entertainer of the Year by Time.[47] In an Instagram post on December 24, 2021, Rodrigo uploaded a snippet of a Christmas song called \"The Bels\" that she wrote and recorded at age five.[48][49] According to Billboard, Rodrigo closed 2021 as the best-selling singles artist worldwide,[50] placing eight songs on the year-end Global 200 chart, including \"Drivers License\" at number four, \"Good 4 U\" at number nine,  and \"Deja Vu\" at number 27.[51] In the US and UK, Sour was respectively the third and fourth best-selling album of 2021.[52][53] Sour and \"Drivers License\" were also respectively Spotify's most streamed album and song globally.[54] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked Rodrigo as the tenth best selling artist of 2021 and Sour as the second best selling album of 2021.[55]On February 17, 2022, Rodrigo announced and released the trailer of her Disney+ documentary film driving home 2 u (a SOUR film), which was released on March 25, 2022.[56] Rodrigo received seven nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Album of the Year for Sour, and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Drivers License\".[57] She won the awards for Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album for Sour, and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Drivers License\".[58]Rodrigo has been described as a pop,[59] pop rock,[60] teen pop,[61] indie pop,[62] alternative pop,[63] and bubblegum pop artist.[64] She cites Taylor Swift and Lorde as her idols and main musical inspirations,[65] and also dubbed herself Swift's biggest fan \"in the whole world\".[66] Her other influences include Alanis Morissette, Kacey Musgraves,[67] Fiona Apple, St. Vincent,[68] Cardi B,[69] Gwen Stefani[70] and Avril Lavigne.[71] Rodrigo has stated that she wants to be a songwriter and not \"the biggest pop star that ever lived\". She revealed that she chose to sign with Interscope/Geffen Records because its CEO praised her songwriting, not her \"potential star quality\".[7] Music journalist Laura Snapes called Rodrigo a \"flag-bearer\" for a new wave of songwriters who incline towards power ballads \"that are as emotional as ever, but project that emotion inward, trading bombast for hush\", and described her musical style as rooted in heartache, mental health, and sadness, without being melodramatic, expressing more realistic perspectives than resilient.[72] Rodrigo's voice type is identified as soprano.[73][74]On July 13, 2021, Rodrigo was involved in a White House effort to promote COVID-19 vaccinations among young people in the US. She met with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci, to discuss her efforts.[75][76][77] CNN reported that Rodrigo would record videos about the importance of young people getting vaccinated, including answering questions the youth have regarding the vaccination.[75] She became Glossier's first ever celebrity-partner in 2022.[78] Rodrigo is also an institute speaker and panelist for the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media.[79]",

I don't plan to make these edits yet as I'm assuming perhaps there's a reason that these things were omitted. If that is the case, would anyone know why that is, or are these things simply missing and should be added? Just food for thought, lemme know!

Rodrigo herself says her family and herself choose to follow Filipino traditions at home. Rodrigo was born in the US and is solely American, she has no citizenship rights in the Philippines based on her great-grand father. The lead and short summary correctly identify her as American per WP:ETHNICITY - she is notable because of what she has done, not because of where her ancestors came from. The personal life section has an appropriate amount of description about her ancestry - just stating the facts. Leave third party opinions of what she is out of the article. The only thing that matter for multi-racial people is what she considers herself.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company": "The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney (/\u02c8d\u026azni/),[3] is an American multinational entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California.Disney was originally founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio;[4] it also operated under the names the Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to the Walt Disney Company in 1986. The company established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks.Since the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is known for its film studio division, Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these various segments, Disney owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, Star+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, a group of 14 theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.[5][6] The cartoon character Mickey Mouse, created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, serves as the company's mascot.[7]The company, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with ticker symbol DIS,[8] has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991.[9] In August 2020, just under two-thirds of the stock was owned by large financial institutions.[10]At Laugh-O-Gram Studio, a film studio in Kansas City founded by Walt Disney and his friend and animator Ub Iwerks,[11] Disney made a short film entitled Alice's Wonderland, which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. In 1923, soon after the short was made, Disney filed for bankruptcy, but the short later became a hit after New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkle purchased it, with Disney signing a contract for six Alice Comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each.[12][13] Before the signing, Disney decided to move to Hollywood to join his brother Roy O. Disney because Roy had tuberculosis.[14] This allowed them to co-find The Disney Brothers Studio to produce the films. He later convinced Iwerks and Davis' family to move to Hollywood as well.[13] In January 1926, with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street, The Disney Brothers Studio's name was changed to Walt Disney Studio.[15] After making several Alice films for the next four years, Winkler handed the role of distributing films to her husband Charles Mintz. In 1927, Mintz asked for a new series of films under Universal Pictures to be made, so Disney created his first series of fully animated films that would feature the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.[16] Walt Disney Studio went on to create 26 films with Oswald in them.[17]In 1928, Disney wanted a larger fee for his films, but Mintz wanted to reduce the price. After Disney found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald, Mintz threatened to produce the films without him if Disney did not take the reductions in payment.[17][18] Disney declined, and Mintz signed four of Disney's primary animators to his studio (Which would later produce cartoons for Columbia Pictures under Screen Gems), with the exception Iwerks who stayed with Disney.[19][16] Because of the loss of Oswald, Disney and Iwerks replaced him with a mouse originally named Mortimer Mouse, until Disney\u2019s wife urged him to change it so he called him Mickey Mouse.[20] In May, they made two silent films with the character, Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, as test screenings. Later, Disney\u2019s first sound film and third short to the Mickey series Steamboat Willie was made with synchronized sound, creating the first post-produced sound cartoon.[21] Disney found Pat Powers\u2019 distribution company to distribute the film, and Steamboat Willie became an immediate hit, leading the way for the companies dominance in the animation industry.[20][22][23] The sound was created using Powers\u2019 Cinephone system, which used Lee de Forest's Phonofilm system.[24] Disney later successfully re-released the two earlier films with synchronized sound in 1929.[25][26]After the release of Steamboat Willie at the Colony Theater in New York, Mickey Mouse became an immensely popular character.[26][20] Disney would go one to make several cartoons featuring Mickey and other characters such as Donald Duck and Goofy.[27] In August, Disney began the Silly Symphony series with Columbia Pictures signing on as the series' distributor, because Walt and Roy felt that they were not getting there share of the profits with Power .[23] Powers would then sign off Iwerks, who would later start his own studio.[28] Carl Starling played a pivotal role in getting the series started and composed the music for the earlier films in the series, but would later leave the company after Iwerks did.[29][30] In September, theater manager Harry Woodin requested permission to start a Mickey Mouse Club at his theater the Fox Dome to boost attendance. Walt agreed, but David E. Dow started one at Elsinore Theatre before Woodin could start his. It is unknown why Woodin did not create the first one, but on December 21, the first ever meeting for the club at Elsinore had around 1,200 children in attendance. The Mickey Mouse Clubs ended up spanning over 800 theaters across the country, with one million kids as members.[31][32] On July 24, Joseph Conley, president of King Features Syndicate, mailed the Disney studio asking for them to make a Mickey Mouse comic strip. They started in November and sent samples of the strip to them, which were approved.[33] On December 16, the Walt Disney Studios partnership was reorganized as a corporation with the name of Walt Disney Productions, Limited, with a merchandising division \u2013 Walt Disney Enterprises, and two subsidiaries \u2013 Disney Film Recording Company, Limited; and Liled Realty and Investment Company, for real estate holdings. Walt and his wife held 60 percent (6,000 shares) and Roy owned 40 percent of the company.[34]The comic strip Mickey Mouse debuted on January 13, 1930, in the New York Daily Mirror and by 1931, the strip was published in 60 newspapers in the US, as well as papers in twenty other countries.[35] After finding out that coming out with merchandise for the characters would generate more revenue for the company, at hotel a man in New York asked Walt for the license to put Mickey Mouse on some writing tablets he was manufacturing for $300. Walt agreed and Mickey became the first licensed character ever, beginning the start of Disney merchandising.[36][37] In 1933, Walt asked a man who owned a Kansas City advertising firm named Kay Kamen to run Disney's merchandising. He agreed and completely transformed Disney's merchandising. Within a year, Kamen had 40 licenses for Mickey and within two years, $35 million worth of sales were made. In 1934, Walt claimed that he made more money from the merchandising of Mickey than from the Mickey films.[38][39] Later, as a part of Disney's merchandising push, the Waterbury Clock Company created a Mickey Mouse watch. It became so popular that it saved Waterbury from bankruptcy during the Great Depression. During a promotional event at Macy\u2019s, 11,000 Mickey Mouse watches sold in one day and within two years, 2.5 million watches were sold.[40][35][39]After a fallout with Colombia Pictures for the Silly Symphonies, Walt signed a distribution contract with United Artist from 1932 to 1937.[41][42] In 1932, Disney signed an exclusive contract with Technicolor through the end of 1935 to produce cartoons in color, beginning with Flowers and Trees (1932), which was part of the Silly Symphonies.[43] The film was the first ever full-color cartoon and won the Academy Award for the Best Cartoon later that year.[21] In 1933, The Three Little Pigs became another popular Silly Symphonies and also won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon.[27][44] The song from the film \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\", composed by Frank Churchill who also wrote other Silly Symphonies songs, became popular throughout the 1930s and remained one of the most well-known Disney songs.[29] Films from Silly Symphonies would go on to win the Best Cartoon award from 1931 to 1939, except for in 1938 when another Disney film Ferdinand the Bull won it.[27]Deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further, Disney began production of his first feature-length animated film in 1934. Taking three years to complete, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, premiered in December 1937 and by 1939 became the highest-grossing film of that time.[45] Snow White was released through RKO Radio Pictures, which had assumed distribution of Disney's product in July 1937,[ChWDC 1] after United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts.[46] Using the profits from Snow White, Disney financed the construction of a new 51-acre (210,000\u00a0m2) studio complex in Burbank, California. The new Walt Disney Studios, in which the company is headquartered to this day, was completed and open for business by the end of 1939.[ChWDC 2] The following year on April 2, Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering.[ChWDC 3][47]The studio continued releasing animated shorts and features, such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942).[48] After World War II began, box office profits declined. When the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many of Disney's animators were drafted into the armed forces. The U.S. and Canadian governments commissioned the studio to produce training and propaganda films. By 1942, 90 percent of its 550 employees were working on war-related films.[49] Films such as the feature Victory Through Air Power and the short Education for Death (both 1943) were meant to increase public support for the war effort. Even the studio's characters joined the effort, as Donald Duck appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts, including the Academy Award-winning Der Fuehrer's Face (1943).With limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war, Disney's feature films during much of the 1940s were \"package films\", or collections of shorts, such as The Three Caballeros (1944) and Melody Time (1948), which performed poorly at the box office. At the same time, the studio began producing live-action films and documentaries. Song of the South (1946) and So Dear to My Heart (1948) featured animated segments, while the True-Life Adventures series, which included such films as Seal Island (1948) and The Vanishing Prairie (1954), were also popular. Eight of the films in the series won Academy Awards.[50]The release of Cinderella in 1950 proved that feature-length animation could still succeed in the marketplace. Other releases of the period included Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953), both in production before the war began, and Disney's first all-live action feature, Treasure Island (1950). Other early all-live-action Disney films included The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952), The Sword and the Rose (1953), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954). Disney ended its distribution contract with RKO in 1953, forming its own distribution arm, Buena Vista Distribution.[51]In December 1950, Walt Disney Productions and the Coca-Cola Company teamed up for Disney's first venture into television, the NBC television network special One Hour in Wonderland. In October 1954, the ABC network launched Disney's first regular television series. In 1954, Walt Disney used his Disneyland series to unveil what would become Disneyland, an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by Robert Cummings, Art Linkletter, and Ronald Reagan. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first monorail system. For the 1964 New York World's Fair, Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1965, \"Disney World\" was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of Orlando, Florida.[52]Disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s. Its weekday afternoon children's television program The Mickey Mouse Club, featuring its roster of young \"Mouseketeers\", premiered in 1955 to great success, as did the Davy Crockett miniseries, starring Fess Parker and broadcast on the Disneyland anthology show.<[48] Two years later, the Zorro series would prove just as popular, running for two seasons on ABC.[53] Despite such success, Walt Disney Productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s,[citation needed] with the exception of the long-running anthology series, later known as The Wonderful World of Disney.[48]Disney's film studios stayed busy as well, averaging five or six releases per year during this period. While the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s, the studio released a number of popular animated features, like Lady and the Tramp (1955), Sleeping Beauty (1959) and One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), which introduced a new xerography process to transfer the drawings to animation cels.[54] Disney's live-action releases were spread across a number of genres, including historical fiction (Johnny Tremain, 1957), adaptations of children's books (Pollyanna, 1960) and modern-day comedies (The Shaggy Dog, 1959). Disney's most successful film of the 1960s was a live action/animated musical adaptation of Mary Poppins, which was one of the all-time highest-grossing movies[48] and received five Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews and Best Song for Robert B. Sherman & Richard M. Sherman for \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\".[55] The theme park design and architectural group became so integral to the Disney studio's operations that the studio bought it on February 5, 1965, along with the WED Enterprises name.[56][57][58][59] On December 15, 1966, Walt Disney died of complications from smoking related lung cancer,[48] marking the end of an era for the company.Following Walt's death, Roy O. Disney took over as chairman, CEO, and president of the company. One of his first acts was to rename Disney World as \"Walt Disney World\" in honor of his brother and his vision.[60] In 1967, the last two films Walt actively supervised were released, the animated feature The Jungle Book[48] and the musical The Happiest Millionaire.[61] The studio released a number of comedies in the late 1960s, including The Love Bug (1969's highest-grossing film)[48] and The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), which starred another young Disney discovery, Kurt Russell. The 1970s opened with the release of Disney's first \"post-Walt\" animated feature, The Aristocats, followed by a return to fantasy musicals in 1971's Bedknobs and Broomsticks.[48] Blackbeard's Ghost was another successful film during this period.[48] On October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World opened to the public, with Roy Disney dedicating the facility in person later that month.On December 20, 1971, Roy O. Disney died of a stroke. He left the company under the control of Donn Tatum, Card Walker, and Walt's son-in-law Ron Miller, each trained by Walt and Roy. While Walt Disney Productions continued releasing family-friendly films throughout the 1970s, such as Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)[48] and Freaky Friday (1976), the films did not fare as well at the box office as earlier material. However, the animation studio saw success with Robin Hood (1973), The Rescuers (1977), and The Fox and the Hound (1981). As head of the studio, Miller attempted to make films to drive the profitable teenage market who generally passed on seeing Disney films.[62] Inspired by the popularity of Star Wars, Disney produced the science-fiction adventure The Black Hole in 1979; it cost $20 million to make, but was lost in Star Wars' wake.[48] The Black Hole was the first Disney film to carry a PG rating in the United States.[62][N 1] Disney dabbled in the horror genre with The Watcher in the Woods, and financed the boldly innovative Tron; both films were released to minimal success.[48]Disney also hired outside producers for film projects, which had never been done before in the studio's history.[62] In 1979, Disney entered a joint venture with Paramount Pictures on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of Popeye and Dragonslayer (1981); the first time Disney collaborated with another studio. Paramount distributed Disney films in Canada at the time, and it was hoped that Disney's marketing prestige would help sell the two films.[62] Finally, in 1982, the Disney family sold the naming rights and rail-based attractions to the Disney film studio for 818,461 shares of Disney stock then worth $42.6 million none of which went to Retlaw. Also, Roy E. Disney objected to the overvalued purchase price of the naming right and voted against the purchase as a Disney board director.[63]The 1983 release of Mickey's Christmas Carol began a string of successful movies, starting with Never Cry Wolf and the Ray Bradbury adaptation Something Wicked This Way Comes.[48] The Walt Disney Productions film division was incorporated on April 1, 1983 as Walt Disney Pictures.[64] In 1984, Disney CEO Ron Miller created Touchstone Films as a brand for Disney to release more major motion pictures. Touchstone's first release was the comedy Splash (1984), which was a box office success.[65] With The Wonderful World of Disney remaining a prime-time staple, Disney returned to television in the 1970s with syndicated programming such as the anthology series The Mouse Factory and a brief revival of the Mickey Mouse Club. In 1980, Disney launched Walt Disney Home Video to take advantage of the newly emerging videocassette market. On April 18, 1983, The Disney Channel debuted as a subscription-level channel on cable systems nationwide, featuring its large library of classic films and TV series, along with original programming and family-friendly third-party offerings.Walt Disney World received much of the company's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In 1978, Disney executives announced plans for the second Walt Disney World theme park, EPCOT Center, which would open in October 1982. Inspired by Walt Disney's dream of a futuristic model city, EPCOT Center was built as a \"permanent World's Fair\", complete with exhibits sponsored by major American corporations, as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations. In Japan, the Oriental Land Company partnered with Walt Disney Productions to build the first Disney theme park outside of the United States, Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in April 1983. Despite the success of the Disney Channel and its new theme park creations, Walt Disney Productions was financially vulnerable. Its film library was valuable but offered few current successes, and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios, particularly the works of Don Bluth, who defected from Disney in 1979. By the early 1980s, the parks were generating 70 percent of Disney's income.[48]In 1984, financier Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings launched a hostile takeover bid for Walt Disney Productions,[48] with the intent of selling off some of its operations.[66] Disney bought out Reliance's 11.1% stake in the company. However, another shareholder filed suit claiming the deal devaluated Disney's stock and for Disney management to retain their positions. The shareholder lawsuit was settled in 1989 for a total of $45 million from Disney and Reliance.[48] Likewise in 1984, MCA (then-parent company of Universal Studios) actually struck a deal with Disney to purchase the company on the condition insisted by the Disney family that Disney CEO Ron W. Miller be MCA president, but disagreements between MCA chairman Lew Wasserman and Disney over this caused the agreement to fall through completely.[67]With the Sid Bass family purchase of 18.7 percent of Disney, Bass and the board brought in Michael Eisner from Paramount as CEO and Frank Wells from Warner Bros. as president. Eisner emphasized Touchstone, with Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1985) leading to increased output with Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), Pretty Woman (1990) and additional hits. Eisner used expanding cable and home video markets to sign deals using Disney shows and films, making a long-term deal with Showtime Networks for Disney/Touchstone releases through 1996 and entering television with syndication and distribution for TV series such as The Golden Girls and Home Improvement. Disney began limited releases of its previous films on videotapes in the late 1980s. Eisner's Disney purchased KHJ, an independent Los Angeles TV station.[48] Organized in 1985, Silver Screen Partners II, LP financed films for Disney with $193 million. In January 1987, Silver Screen III began financing movies for Disney with $300 million raised, the largest amount raised for a film financing limited partnership by E.F. Hutton.[68] Silver Screen IV was also set up to finance Disney's studios.[69]Buoyed by the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, Disney's flagship animation studio enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes known as the Disney Renaissance, with such films as The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). In addition, the company successfully entered the field of television animation with a number of lavishly-budgeted and acclaimed series such as Adventures of the Gummi Bears, DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, Bonkers and Gargoyles.[70] Disney moved to first place in box office receipts by 1988 and had increased revenues by 20 percent every year.[48]In 1989, Disney signed an agreement-in-principle to acquire Jim Henson Productions from its founder, Muppet creator Jim Henson. The deal included Henson's programming library and Muppet characters (excluding the Muppets created for Sesame Street), as well as Jim Henson's personal creative services. However, Henson died suddenly in May 1990 before the deal was completed, resulting in the two companies terminating merger negotiations the following December.[71] Named the \"Disney Decade\" by the company, the executive talent attempted to move the company to new heights in the 1990s with huge changes and accomplishments.[48] In September 1990, Disney arranged for financing up to $200 million by a unit of Nomura Securities for Interscope films made for Disney. On October 23, Disney formed Touchwood Pacific Partners which would supplant the Silver Screen Partnership series as their movie studios' primary source of funding.[69]In 1991, hotels, home video distribution, and Disney merchandising became 28 percent of total company revenues while international revenues contributed 22 percent of total revenues. The company committed its studios in the first quarter of 1991 to produce 25 films in 1992. However, 1991 saw net income drop by 23 percent and had no growth for the year, but saw the release of Beauty and the Beast, winner of two Academy Awards and top-grossing film in the genre. Disney next moved into publishing with Hyperion Books and adult music with Hollywood Records while Walt Disney Imagineering was laying off 400 employees.[48] Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then-Disney Studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg acquired Miramax Films in 1993. That same year Disney created the NHL team the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, named after the 1992 hit film of the same name. Disney purchased a minority stake in the Anaheim Angels baseball team around the same time.[48]Wells was killed in a helicopter crash in 1994.[48] Shortly thereafter, Katzenberg resigned and formed DreamWorks SKG because Eisner would not appoint Katzenberg to Wells' now-available post (Katzenberg had also sued over the terms of his contract).[48] Instead, Eisner recruited his friend Michael Ovitz, one of the founders of the Creative Artists Agency, to be President, with minimal involvement from Disney's board of directors (which at the time included Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier, Hilton Hotels Corporation CEO Stephen Bollenbach, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, Yale dean Robert A. M. Stern, and Eisner's predecessors Raymond Watson and Card Walker). Ovitz lasted only 14 months and left Disney in December 1996 via a \"no fault termination\" with a severance package of $38\u00a0million in cash and 3 million stock options worth roughly $100\u00a0million at the time of Ovitz's departure. The Ovitz episode engendered a long-running derivative suit, which finally concluded in June 2006, almost 10 years later. Chancellor William B. Chandler III of the Delaware Court of Chancery, despite describing Eisner's behavior as falling \"far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position...\" found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they had not violated the letter of the law (namely, the duty of care owed by a corporation's officers and board to its shareholders).[72] Eisner later said, in a 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, that he regretted letting Ovitz go.[73]In 1994, Eisner attempted to purchase NBC from General Electric (GE), but the deal failed due to GE wanting to keep 51 percent ownership of the network. On August 1, 1995, Disney announced a $19 billion merger of equals with Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which at the time was the second largest corporate takeover. The merger would bring broadcast network ABC and its assets, including a 37.5% minority stake in A&E Television Networks, an 80 percent majority stake in ESPN and the Limited Partnership-ran DIC Productions into the Disney umbrella.[48] The deal was closed on February 10, 1996, and Eisner felt that the purchase of ABC was an important investment to keep Disney surviving and allowing it to compete with international multimedia conglomerates.[74] Disney lost a $10.4 million lawsuit in September 1997 to Marsu B.V. over Disney's failure to produce as contracted 13 half-hour Marsupilami cartoon shows. Instead, Disney felt other internal \"hot properties\" deserved the company's attention.[75]Disney, which had taken control of the Anaheim Angels in 1996, purchased a majority stake in the team in 1998. That same year, Disney began a move into the Internet field with the purchase of Starwave and 43 percent of Infoseek. In 1999, Disney purchased the remaining shares of Infoseek and launched the Go Network portal in January. Disney also launched its cruise line with the christening of Disney Magic and a sister ship, Disney Wonder.[48] The Katzenberg case dragged on as his contract included a portion of the film revenue from ancillary markets forever. Katzenberg had offered $100 million to settle the case, but Eisner felt the original claim amount of about half a billion too much, but then the ancillary market clause was found. Disney lawyers tried to indicate a decline situation which reveal some of the problems in the company. ABC had declining rating and increasing costs while the film segment had two film failures. While neither party revealed the settlement amount, it is estimated at $200 million.[48]Eisner's controlling style inhibited efficiency and progress according to some critics, while other industry experts indicated that \"age compression\" theory led to a decline in the company's target market due to youth copying teenage behavior earlier.[48] The year 2000 brought an increase in revenue of 9 percent and net income of 39 percent with ABC and ESPN leading the way and Parks and Resorts marking its sixth consecutive year of growth. In November 2000, Andy Heyward purchased back DIC Entertainment from Disney (through investment by Bain Capital and Chase Capital Partners) and making the studio re-independent.[76] On July 23, 2001, Disney announced to purchase Fox Family Worldwide for $2.9 billion cash plus $2.3 billion in debt assumption, which would include ownership in the Fox Family Channel alongside other assets including the Saban Entertainment library and Fox Kids channels in Europe and Latin America.[77] The purchase was completed on October 24, 2001, and Fox Family would be renamed to ABC Family in November.The year 2001 was one of cost-cutting, laying off 4,000 employees, Disney parks operations decreased, slashing annual live-action film investment, and minimizing Internet operations, mainly due to the September 11 attacks, which led to a decline in vacation travel and the early 2000s recession led to a decrease in ABC revenue. While 2002 revenue had a small decrease from 2001 with the cost-cutting, net income rose to $1.2 billion with two creative film releases. In 2003, Disney became the first studio to record over $3 billion in worldwide box office receipts.[48] Eisner did not want the board to renominate Roy E. Disney, the son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney, as a board director citing his age of 72 as a required retirement age. Stanley Gold responded by resigning from the board and requesting the other board members oust Eisner.[48] On November 30, 2003, Disney resigned from his positions as the company's vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation,[ChWDC 4] accusing Eisner of micromanagement, failures with the ABC television network, timidity in the theme park business, turning the Walt Disney Company into a \"rapacious, soul-less\" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box office film flops starting in the year 2000.On August 9, 2002, Disney said it was expressing great interest in buying Universal Studios whose parent company Vivendi started a bidding war after inheriting $17.9 billion in debt by its purchase of the famed major film studio from Seagram for $34 billion.[78] In addition, Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure was struggling to deal with catastrophically low attendance since the park's opening in 1999, and the September 11 attacks in 2001 caused a dip of Universal Parks and Resorts' tourism attendance worldwide. As a result, Vivendi lacked the interest in investing in the Universal parks more meaningfully and may have been one of the reasons for selling off Universal.[79] Analysts speculated that Universal would have to be available at a bargain price to justify such a deal. \"Owning more theme parks could make Disney even more cyclical because that's a cyclical business,\" said Katherine Styponias of Prudential Securities.[78] Despite this, Disney didn't succeed in pursuing a takeover for various reasons, owing to its stock price at a 52-week-low and the likelihood of the Disney/Universal deal being blocked on antitrust grounds (e.g. less innovation in theme parks, higher prices for hotel rooms, the growing power of box office market share, etc.).[79]On May 15, 2003, Disney sold their stake in the Anaheim Angels baseball team to Arte Moreno. Disney purchased the rights to The Muppets and the Bear in the Big Blue House franchises from The Jim Henson Company on February 17, 2004.[80] The two brands were placed under control of the Muppets Holding Company, LLC, a unit of Disney Consumer Products.[81] In 2004, Pixar Animation Studios began looking for another distributor after its 12-year contract with Disney ended, due to its strained relationship over issues of control and money with Eisner. Also that year, Comcast Corporation made an unsolicited $54 billion bid to acquire Disney. A couple of high budget films flopped at the box office. With these difficulties and with some board directors dissatisfied, Eisner ceded the board chairmanship.[48]On March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising 45 percent of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, withheld their proxies to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.[ChWDC 5] In February 2005, Disney sold the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team to Henry and Susan Samueli, who later renamed the team the Anaheim Ducks.[48] On March 13, 2005, Robert A. Iger was announced as Eisner's successor as CEO. Also that month, Miramax co-founders Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein departed the company to form their own studio. On July 8, Walt Disney's nephew, Roy E. Disney, returned to the company as a consultant and as non-voting director emeritus. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts celebrated the 50th anniversary of Disneyland Park on July 17 and opened Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12. On July 25, Disney announced that it was closing DisneyToon Studios Australia in October 2006 after 17 years of existence.[82] On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the Board of Directors.[ChWDC 6]On October 1, 2005, Bob Iger replaced Eisner as Disney's CEO. On November 4, Walt Disney Feature Animation released Chicken Little, the company's first film using 3D animation. On January 23, 2006, it was announced that Disney would purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction valued at $7.4\u00a0billion. The deal was finalized on May 5; Steve Jobs, who was Pixar's CEO and held a 50.1% ownership stake in the company, transitioned to Disney's board of directors as its largest individual shareholder, with a 7 percent stake.[83][84] Ed Catmull took over as President of Pixar Animation Studios. Former executive vice-president of Pixar, John Lasseter, became chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, its division Disneytoon Studios, and Pixar Animation Studios, as well as assuming the role of principal creative advisor at Walt Disney Imagineering.[84]In February 2006, Disney acquired the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBC Universal (including the character's intellectual property and the 27 Oswald cartoons produced by Walt Disney) as part of an exchange of minor assets. In return, Disney released sportscaster Al Michaels from his contracts with ABC Sports and ESPN, so he could join NBC Sports and his long-time partner John Madden for NBC's new NFL Sunday Night Football.[85] In April 2007, the Muppets Holding Company was moved from Disney Consumer Products to the Walt Disney Studios division and renamed The Muppets Studio, as part of efforts to re-launch the division.[86][80] In February 2007, the company was accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise.[87][88]On August 31, 2009, Disney announced a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4.24 billion, in a deal completed on December 31, 2009.[89][90]Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney died of stomach cancer on December 16, 2009. At the time of his death, he owned roughly 1 percent of Disney stock, which amounted to 16 million shares. He was the last member of the Disney family to be actively involved in the company.[91] In October 2009, Disney Channel president Rich Ross, hired by Iger, replaced Dick Cook as chairman of the company and, in November, began restructuring the company to focus more on family friendly products. Later in January 2010, Disney decided to shut down Miramax after downsizing Touchstone, but one month later, they instead began selling the Miramax brand and its 700-title film library to Filmyard Holdings. In March, ImageMovers Digital, which Disney had established as a joint venture studio with Robert Zemeckis in 2007, was shut down. In April 2010, Lyric Street, Disney's country music label in Nashville, was shut down. The following month, Haim Saban reacquired the Power Rangers franchise, including its 700-episode library.[92] In September 2012, Saban reacquired the Digimon franchise, which, like Power Rangers, was part of the Fox Kids library that Disney acquired in 2001.[93] In January 2011, Disney Interactive Studios was downsized.[94]In April 2011, Disney broke ground on Shanghai Disney Resort. Costing $4.4 billion, the resort opened on June 16, 2016.[95] Later, in August 2011, Bob Iger stated on a conference call that after the success of the Pixar and Marvel purchases, he and the Walt Disney Company are looking to \"buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of creating great characters and great stories.\"[96] Later, in early February 2012, Disney completed its acquisition of UTV Software Communications, expanding their market further into India and Asia.[97] On October 30, 2012, Disney announced plans to acquire Lucasfilm in a deal valued at $4.05 billion. Disney announced an intent to leverage the Star Wars franchise across its divisions, and planned to produce a seventh installment in the main film franchise for release in 2015.[98][99] The sale was completed on December 21, 2012.[100] On March 24, 2014, Disney acquired Maker Studios, an active multi-channel network on YouTube, for $500 million.[101] The company was later turned into a new venture called Disney Digital Network in May 2017.[102]On February 5, 2015, it was announced that Tom Staggs had been promoted to COO.[103] On April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, effective May 2016, ending his 26-year career with the company.[104] In August 2016, Disney acquired a 33 percent stake in BAMTech, a streaming media provider spun out from Major League Baseball's media division. The company announced plans to eventually use its infrastructure for an ESPN over-the-top service.[105][106]In September 2016, Disney considered purchasing the American online news and social networking service Twitter,[107][108] but they dropped out partly due to concerns over abuse and harassment on the service.[109][110][111]On March 23, 2017, Disney announced that Iger had agreed to a one-year extension of his term as CEO through July 2, 2019, and had agreed to remain with the company as a consultant for three years after stepping down.[112][113] In August 2017, Disney announced that it had exercised an option to increase its stake in BAMTech to 75 percent, and would launch a subscription video-on-demand service featuring its entertainment content in 2019, which will replace Netflix as the subscription VOD rights holder of all Disney theatrical film releases.[114][115] In November 2017, Lasseter announced that he was taking a six-month leave of absence from Pixar and Disney Animation after acknowledging \"missteps\" in his behavior with employees in a memo to staff. According to various news outlets, Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees.[116][117]In November 2017, it was reported by CNBC that Disney had been in negotiations to acquire 21st Century Fox. The negotiations had reportedly resumed around Disney acquiring several of Fox's key media assets. Rumors of a nearing deal continued on December 5, 2017, with additional reports suggesting that the FSN regional sports networks would be included in the resulting new company (assets that would likely be aligned with Disney's ESPN division).[118][119][120][121] On December 14, Disney agreed to acquire most assets from 21st Century Fox, including 20th Century Fox, for $52.4\u00a0billion.[122] The merger included many of Fox's entertainment assets\u2014including filmed entertainment, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions in the UK, Europe, and Asia[123]\u2014but excluded divisions such as the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, the Fox News Channel, the Fox Business Network, Fox Sports 1 and 2, and the Big Ten Network, all of which were to be spun off into an independent company before the merger was complete (which eventually named Fox Corporation).[124] The following June, after a counter offer from Comcast worth $65\u00a0billion, Disney increased its offer to $71.3\u00a0billion.[125] The transaction officially closed on March 20, 2019.[126][127] Under the terms of acquisition, Disney will phase-out Fox brand usage by 2024.[128]Beginning in March 2018, a strategic reorganization of the company saw the creation of two business segments, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products and Direct-to-Consumer & International. Parks & Consumer Products was primarily a merger of Parks & Resorts and Consumer Products & Interactive Media. While Direct-to-Consumer & International took over for Disney International and global sales, distribution and streaming units from Disney-ABC TV Group and Studios Entertainment plus Disney Digital Network.[129] Given that CEO Iger described it as \"strategically positioning our businesses for the future\", The New York Times considered the reorganization done in expectation of the 21st Century Fox purchase.[130]On February 25, 2020, Disney named Bob Chapek as CEO to succeed Iger, effective immediately. Iger assumed the role of Executive Chairman, under which he would oversee the creative side of the company, while also continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board during the transition period through 2021.[131][132]In April 2020, Iger resumed operational duties of the company as executive chairman to help the company during the COVID-19 pandemic and Chapek was appointed to the board of directors.[133][134] Also in the month, the company announced that it would suspend pay to more than 100,000 employees (\"cast members\") at Disney Parks, Experiences and Products in response to the COVID-19 recession\u2014reportedly amounting to monthly savings of $500 million for the company\u2014while continuing to provide full healthcare benefits. Reportedly, staff in the United States and France were affected and were encouraged to apply for government support.[135]Due to the closure of Disney parks during the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney experienced a 63 percent drop in earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2020, resulting in a loss of $1.4 billion for the company. Additionally, the Parks, Experiences, and Products division experienced a loss of $1 billion in revenue.[136] In September 2020, the company announced that it will be laying off 28,000 employees in Florida and California. According to Disney's park chairman, Josh D'Amaro, \"We initially hoped that this situation would be shortlived and that we would recover quickly and return to normal. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case.\" According to D'Amaro, two-thirds of the employees reported to be laid off were part-time workers.[137] Then in November, Disney planned to cut 4000 jobs more than announced until the end of March 2021.[138]In December 2020, Disney named Alan Bergman as chairman of its Disney Studios Content division to oversee its film studios.[139] In March 2021, Disney announced a new division, 20th Television Animation, that would focus on adult animation.[140]In July 2021, Disney announced that over an 18-month period it would move about 2,000 employees from its California headquarters to a new campus in Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida, to consolidate operations and take advantage of a more \"business-friendly climate\".[141]On March 10, 2022, Disney announced that it will pause all business operations in Russia due the country's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis it has caused.[142] Disney was the first major Hollywood studio to halt the release of a major motion picture due to Russia's invasion, and other movie studios such as Warner Bros. Pictures and Sony Pictures followed soon after.[143]Through February and March 2022, Disney's response to a Florida bill prohibiting discussion in schools about gender and sexual identity (HB 1557, known as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill) led to controversy over the company's lack of condemnation and previous restrictions on LGBT content, eventually leading to a rare walkout by employees.[144]The Walt Disney Company operates six primary business segments (two primary divisions and four content groups):[145]In addition, Marvel Entertainment is a business reporting directly to the CEO; its financial results are primarily divided between the Studios and Consumer Products segments.[152]Walt Disney stepped down as chairman in 1960 to focus more on the creative aspects of the company, becoming the \"executive producer in charge of all production.\"[153]\nAfter a four-year vacancy, Roy O. Disney became chairman.Disney ranked No. 55 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[183]The Walt Disney Company has been criticized for the purportedly sexist, racist, or overly commercial artistic direction of certain pieces of its intellectual property. It has also received criticism for offering poor pay and working conditions, engaging in anticompetitive practices, and treating animals poorly.",

The teacher decides to stage a performance of High School Musical: The Musical for her first winter theater production to celebrate the school's affiliation with the original film.[3][4] The students cast in the musical learn to navigate their interpersonal relationships and form bonds with each other, to overcome the challenges they face in their lives at school and home.In the second season, the

Lake.[7][8][9] The campers prepare to stage a production of Frozen.[9]On November 9, 2017, it was announced that Disney was developing a television series adaptation of their High School Musical film series created by Peter Barsocchini.[15][16] The series was expected to premiere on Disney's then-unnamed upcoming streaming service.[15][16] The company had planned to adapt the franchise for television and approached creator Tim Federle to develop an idea for a series.[17] Federle pitched the documentary-style series in January 2018 and went on to draft the pilot together with Disney Channel, who contributed to the production of the series.[17][18][19]On May 30, 2018, it was announced that Federle would serve as a writer and executive producer for the series.[20] On September 6, Disney officially gave the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.[3] Oliver Goldstick was expected to serve as showrunner and an additional executive producer while Julie Ashton would oversee the casting process.[3] Alongside this announcement, it was also revealed that the show would be of the mockumentary genre and a list of character names and descriptions was

Rock in addition to the High School Musical franchise.[9]Federle drew inspiration for the mockumentary style of the series from other films and programs such as Waiting for Guffman and The Office.[23] He was inspired to create a series that depicted music as a central theme, while also drawing on his experience as a former Broadway performer.[23][27]The series is inclusive of LGBTQ representation, with two gay characters featured: Carlos and Seb.[28][29] In an interview with The Advocate, Frankie Rodriguez credited Federle for writing his character Carlos as gay without drawing on the tropes of a typical queer character.[28] The character Seb plays the role of Sharpay in the musical, an example of non-traditional gender casting.[28][29] The series begins the exploration of a same-sex relationship when Carlos asks Seb to the school dance in the episode \"Homecoming\".[30][31] The series also depicts same-sex parenting through Nini's two mothers Carol and Dana.[28][29] In addition to this representation, the series includes themes such as divorce.[32]Federle expressed the importance of casting real teenagers in main roles to add authenticity to the high school-based series.[17] On October 17, 2018, it was announced that Joshua Bassett had been cast in a leading role.[33] The rest of the cast was announced on February 15, 2019, including Sofia Wylie as Gina, Kate Reinders as Miss Jenn, and Olivia Rodrigo as Nini.[34][35] Federle confirmed in November 2019 that an unnamed cast member from the original film would make a cameo appearance through a fantasy sequence.[19][36] After being listed as a featured artist on the soundtrack, Lucas Grabeel, who played Ryan Evans, was confirmed to be making an appearance on the series.[37][38] Grabeel appears in the episode \"The Tech Rehearsal\" as a fictionalized version of himself, performing in a song alongside Reinders.[38] Kaycee Stroh, who played Martha Cox, also makes a cameo appearance in the episode \"What Team?\"[39]In December 2019, it was reported that Joe Serafini, who plays Seb Matthew-Smith, would be promoted to the main cast for the second season.[40] Further additions to the recurring cast were revealed in early 2020: Roman Banks as Howie; Olivia Rose Keegan as Lily; and Derek Hough as Zack, Miss Jenn's ex-boyfriend.[41][42][43] In February 2021, Andrew Barth Feldman and Asher Angel joined the cast for the second season in recurring guest roles, as Antoine and Jack respectively.[6][44] That July, it was revealed that Jordan Fisher would guest star as Jamie Porter in the penultimate episode of the second season.[45]Time reported in December 2021 that Rodrigo would return for the third season, amidst speculation she would not due to her music career.[46][47] It was later stated that Rodrigo would return in a recurring role as opposed to the series regular status she maintained in the first two seasons.[48] The casting for the third season was made public in January 2022, with Bassett, Cornett, Wylie, Lester, Rene\u00e9, Rodriguez and Reinders also confirmed to be returning.[49] Keegan was promoted to the main cast for the third season.[49] Adrian Lyles and Saylor Bell joined the cast as new series regulars, playing Jet and Maddox respectively.[49] Further additions to the guest cast included Jason Earles as Dewey Wood and Meg Donnelly as Val.[50] Also appearing is Corbin Bleu, who starred in the original film series, playing himself.[50] Three further recurring characters were announced in March; Ben Stillwell, Aria Brooks and Liamani Segura as Channing, Alex and Emmy respectively.[51]Production on the first season began on February 15, 2019, in Salt Lake City, Utah, and concluded on June 30.[52][53] Production on the second season commenced in February 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[54][55] Filming had resumed by November 2020.[56] Filming for the third season commenced in January 2022, in Los Angeles rather than Salt Lake City.[7][9]The mockumentary style of the series is achieved through the single-camera setup,[33] with handheld cameras used to create shaky footage and zooming.[57] In addition, talking heads are utilized to allow characters to express their inner thoughts while talking to the camera.[57] These scenes represent the \"present-day\" in the story, while flashbacks to Nini and Ricky's past relationship are filmed more traditionally.[57]The first season contains nine original songs, with one new piece of music featured in each of the first nine episodes. The majority of songs are performed live by the actors.[58][23][59] Some actors accompanied their own performances on instruments such as the guitar.[17] Rodrigo wrote an original song for the series, \"All I Want\", and co-wrote \"Just for a Moment\" with Bassett and music producer Dan Book.[60][61] Federle stated that his original pitch included the idea of developing original songs for the series.[23] Steve Vincent, who worked on the original films, served as the musical supervisor for the series and sourced several composers to write new music.[23][58] He also received submissions from songwriters based in Los Angeles.[58] The soundtrack for the first season, featuring new songs and renditions of songs from the original film, was released on January 10, 2020, by Walt Disney Records.[60] In the lead-up to the release, selected tracks were made available weekly to correlate with the episodes being released.[60]An album accompanying the holiday special, High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special: The Soundtrack, was released on November 20, 2020, which includes Christmas music as well as selected songs as a preview of the second season.[14] As well as both new songs and new versions of songs from the High School Musical franchise, the second season features songs from Beauty and the Beast, written by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice.[5] Bassett and Rodrigo both wrote original songs for the second season.[56]The first episode of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series was telecast on Disney Channel, ABC, and Freeform on November 8, 2019,[10] ahead of its launch on the streaming service Disney+ on November 12, 2019,[62] in 4K HDR.[63] Episodes were released weekly rather than all at once.[64] The first-season finale was released on January 10, 2020.[58]A 45-minute holiday special entitled High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special, featuring the cast performing Christmas music, was released on December 11, 2020.[56] The special featured previews of songs and scenes from the second season.[56] The second season premiered on May 14, 2021.[6] The season was originally planned to debut in 2020, but was delayed as a result of filming being halted during the COVID-19 pandemic.[54][55] Prior to the release of the second season, the complete first season aired a marathon viewing format on Disney Channel on May 8, 2021.[65]The preview simulcast of the first episode on November 8, 2019, was viewed by 2.03\u00a0million on ABC, in addition to 474,000 on Disney Channel and 293,000 during its Freeform airing.[66] The broadcast received 2.8\u00a0million viewers in total.[66]The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval rating for the first season with an average rating of 7.38/10 based on 32 ratings. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though fans may find what they've been looking for in its nostalgic stylings, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series follows a little too closely in its predecessors steps to truly be the start of something new.\"[67] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[68]Vinnie Mancuso of Collider described the series as \"endearingly tongue-in-cheek\".[69] Kelly Lawler expressed that the series is a \"love letter\" to high school theater productions in a review for USA Today.[70] Kendra Cleary of Hypable stated that the series captures the energy of the original movie while introducing a relatable set of characters that are not as stereotypical as Troy and Gabriella.[71] However, Caroline Framke of Variety suggested that some elements of the program are too similar to the original movie's \"two-dimensional\" approach.[72] Insider's Libby Torres said the series lacked the \"infectious energy\" of the original film and found the premise jarring.[73] Mancuso objected to the mockumentary style of the series, noting that the format distracts from other humor in the episodes.[69] /Film's Ethan Anderton noted the technique as inorganic and unnecessary.[74] Conversely, Cleary listed the talking heads as one of her favourite aspect of the series.[71] Daniel Toy of Tom's Guide indicated how the techniques help to avoid unfamiliarity with characters.[75] In his Laughing Place blog, Alex Reif said the series was more aimed at adults than the original movies.[76] Joel Keller of Decider suggested that viewing of the series does not require an understanding of the original franchise.[77]Shannon Miller of The A.V. Club praised the cast's talent, in particular Rodrigo and Bassett for their musical ability and \"handling of dramatic material\".[4] Writing for Decider, Kayla Cobb stated that the two leads have significant romantic chemistry.[78] Megan Peters of Comicbook.com praised Rodrigo for her portrayal of Nini's \"cautious\" personality, and Keller described her as \"especially magnetic\".[77][79] Anderton also applauded the cast and suggested that the series does not feature the same \"exaggerated acting style\" as the source material.[74] The show's choreography was commended, as well as Wylie for her dance capability.[4][78] Toy described Rodriguez's comedic timing as Carlos as \"impeccable\".[75] Anderton, Peters and Framke likened Kate Reinders's performance as the \"overzealous\" Miss Jenn to Kristin Chenoweth.[72][74][79]The series has been likened to Glee for its themes, as well as its combination of music and drama.[69][71][78] Framke described the series as a \"sweet and very silly version of Glee\", and Peters noted similarities through its \"quick cuts and quips\".[79][72] However, Miller stated that High School Musical uses music more as a literal than abstract element in the storyline.[4] Cleary noted that the series is not a musical in itself, and that the songs appear organically, depicted through auditions and rehearsals.[71]Reviewing the music, Mancuso and Toy expressed interest in the program continuing to provide new songs in addition to the original movie's soundtrack.[69][75] Cleary praised the \"vibrant and nostalgic\" score.[71] Cobb commended the vocal abilities of the main cast and described Rodrigo as \"an especially pronounced talent\" with a sweet and sincere voice.[78]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Geffen_Records": "Geffen Records is an American record label established by David Geffen and owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M Records imprint.Founded in 1980, Geffen Records has been a part of Interscope Geffen A&M since 1999 and has been used by Universal Music as a syndicating division, serving its purpose to operate as a premier label for many new releases since 2003 and its 2017 reboot and at the same time to reissue many releases from recording labels such as Decca Records (exclusively the American pop/rock catalog), Kapp Records, DreamWorks Records, MCA Records, Uni Records, Chess Records, Almo Sounds (Recently, Interscope has managed reissues of the label in 2015), Dot Records, and ABC Records (primarily its pop, rock, and R&B recordings).The label has released significant recordings from artists including Elton John, Kylie Minogue, Enya, Counting Crows, Cher, Guns N' Roses, Tesla, John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, Aerosmith, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, Donna Summer, and more recently Nirvana, Weezer, Mary J. Blige, Blink-182, Avicii, Keyshia Cole, Lifehouse, Beck, Nelly Furtado, Lil Durk, Marshmello, Rise Against, Olivia Rodrigo, Snoop Dogg and Rob Zombie.Geffen Records began operations in 1980, having been started by music industry businessman David Geffen[1] who, in the early 1970s, had founded Asylum Records. Geffen stepped down from Asylum in 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named a vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures. He was fired from Warner circa 1978, but still remained locked in a five-year contract, which prevented him from working elsewhere. When that deal expired, he returned to work in 1980 and struck a deal with, ironically, Warner Records, the sister company to Warner Bros. Pictures, to create Geffen Records. Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label's start-up and operations and Warner distributed its releases in North America, while Epic Records handled distribution in the rest of the world until 1985. In that year, Warner Bros. took over distribution for the rest of the world. Profits were split 50/50 between Geffen Records and its respective distributors.Geffen Records' first artist signing was superstar Donna Summer, whose gold-selling album The Wanderer became the label's first release in 1980. The label then released Double Fantasy by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Two weeks after it entered the charts, Lennon was murdered in New York City. Subsequently, the album went on to sell millions and gave Geffen its first number-one album and single; the rights to the album would later be taken over by EMI, which eventually was absorbed by Geffen's parent Universal Music.As the 1980s progressed, Geffen would go on to have success with such acts as Berlin, Enya, Kylie Minogue, Quarterflash, Wang Chung, and Sammy Hagar. The label also signed several established acts such as Elton John, Irene Cara, Cher, Debbie Harry, Don Henley, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, and Jennifer Holliday. Toward the end of the decade, the company also began making a name for itself as an emerging rock label, thanks to the success of Whitesnake (U.S. and Canada only), The Stone Roses, Guns N' Roses, Tesla, Sonic Youth and the comeback of 1970s-era rockers Aerosmith.  This prompted Geffen to create a subsidiary label, DGC Records in 1990; which focused on more progressive rock and would later embrace the emergence of alternative rock\u2014Nirvana being an example. Geffen also briefly distributed the first incarnation of Def American Recordings through Warner Music Group from 1988 to 1990.After a decade of operating through WMG, when its contract with the company expired, the label was sold to MCA Music Entertainment (later renamed Universal Music Group) in 1990. The deal ultimately earned David Geffen an estimated US$800 million in stock (until the Japanese conglomerate, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.'s cash acquisition of MCA in 1991, made Geffen a billionaire) and an employment contract that ran until 1995. Following the sale, Geffen Records operated as one of MCA's leading independently managed labels. Geffen stepped down as head of the label in 1995 to collaborate with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg to form DreamWorks SKG, an ambitious multimedia empire dealing in film, television, books and music. Geffen Records would distribute releases on the new operation's DreamWorks Records subsidiary. In January 1996, Geffen Records funded and distributed a short-lived boutique label Outpost Recordings featuring the likes of Whiskeytown, Ry Cooder, Veruca Salt, and Hayden.[2]Universal Music Group acquired PolyGram in 1999, resulting in a corporate reorganization of labels. Geffen Records, along with A&M Records, was subsequently merged into Interscope Records. Although Geffen would continue to exist as a brand, it was downsized to fit into the greater expansion of Interscope. At the same time, international distribution of Interscope and Geffen releases switched to ex-PolyGram label Polydor Records, which had already been distributing A&M releases overseas (in return for A&M handling Polydor releases in the U.S.).By 2000, despite Geffen Records no longer being independently operated within UMG and taking a more submissive position behind Interscope, it continued to do steady business\u2014so much so that in 2003, UMG folded MCA Records into Geffen. Though Geffen had been substantially a pop-rock label, its absorption of MCA (and its back catalogs) led to a more diverse roster; with former MCA artists such as Mary J. Blige, The Roots, Blink-182, Rise Against and Common now featured on the label.  Meanwhile, DreamWorks Records also folded, with artists such as Nelly Furtado, Lifehouse and Rufus Wainwright being absorbed by Geffen as well. During this time, DGC Records was also folded into Geffen, with retained artists now recording for Geffen directly (DGC was reactivated in 2007, however it would now operate through Interscope Records instead).As the 2000s progressed, Geffen's absorption of the MCA and DreamWorks labels, along with continuing to sign new acts such as Ashlee Simpson, Angels & Airwaves, Snoop Dogg and The Game, had boosted the company to the extent that it began gaining equal footing with the main Interscope label, leading some industry insiders to speculate that it could revert to operating as an independently managed imprint at UMG again. At the end of 2007, however, Geffen was absorbed further into Interscope.[3] The restructuring resulted in Geffen laying off sixty employees.[4][5]In 2009, it was announced that Geffen Records had signed an agreement with the Holy See to produce an album of Marian songs and prayers from Pope Benedict XVI.[6]Jimmy Iovine relaunched the Geffen imprint in 2011, moving its headquarters from California to New York City. Gee Roberson was appointed chairman.[7]In March 2017, Neil Jacobson was appointed President of Geffen Records to oversee the relaunch of the label via new signings as well as reinvigoration of the label's legendary catalog.[8] In December 2019, Jacobson left Geffen to start Crescent Drive Productions.[9]In January 2020, Lee L'Heureux was appointed General Manager of Geffen Records.[10]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Interscope_Records": "Interscope Records is an American record label owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M imprint. Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20\u00a0million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group,[2] it differed from most record companies by letting A&R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control.[3] Its first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993.[4] Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.[5]In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from the hardcore hip hop label Death Row, whose artists included Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, owning Atlantic, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115\u00a0million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200\u00a0million by MCA Inc.,[4][6][7] later known as Universal Music Group.Based in Santa Monica, California, Interscope's artist roster includes Lady Gaga, Eminem, OneRepublic, Dermot Kennedy, Blackpink, Dr. Dre, DaBaby, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez,  Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, Maroon 5, Moneybagg Yo, Gwen Stefani, Rae Sremmurd, Machine Gun Kelly, U2, and others.In 1989, Ted Field began to build Interscope Records as a division of his film company, Interscope Communications.  To run it, he hired John McClain, who had played a central role in Janet Jackson's success at A&M Records,  and Tom Whalley, who had been the head of A&R at Capitol Records. Separately, Iovine, who had produced records for U2, Bruce Springsteen, and John Lennon, among others, was trying to raise money to start a label.  \"I thought, 'Music is going to change,'\" Iovine said in 1997. \"'Young bands aren't going to be asking for me.' But I love working with the new thing. I always liked the part of the business that's the first time you hear something, and I knew I wasn't in that business anymore.\"[8]Iovine and Field were introduced by Paul McGuinness, then U2's manager.  After a series of negotiations led by David Geffen, they came to an agreement, and in 1990, Interscope Records was founded as a joint venture with Atlantic Records.  In a 1997 article in Rolling Stone, David Wild wrote: \"Interscope's start-up coincided with a period of incredible change in the music world. Nirvana had ushered in the alternative revolution... While the major labels were packed with rosters full of expensive veteran artists who had to redefine themselves for a new rock era, Interscope was in the business of signing new artists and could \u2013 as Iovine puts it \u2013 'move on a dime.'\"[8][9][10][11]Based in Los Angeles, California in the Westwood neighborhood at an office building on 10900  Wilshire Boulevard, Interscope was run by \"music men\".  It was a departure from the music industry practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when labels traditionally appointed lawyers and promotion executives to senior positions.  A founding tenet of the label was that artists would have complete creative control.[4]Interscope's first release was \"Rico Suave\" by Ecuadorian rapper Gerardo in December 1990; the single reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in April 1991. Primus' Interscope debut, Sailing the Seas of Cheese, was released in May, followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's Music for the People in July.  It included the number-one single \"Good Vibrations\". Two days after first hearing his demo, Whalley signed Tupac Shakur in August 1991, and by November, Interscope released 2Pacalypse Now, Shakur's studio debut.[12]Interscope began to develop a significant presence in the alternative genre in 1992. In addition to a second Primus album, the label released No Doubt's self-titled debut, Helmet's Meantime, 4 Non Blondes' Bigger, Better, Faster, More!, acquired and re-released Rocket from the Crypt's Circa: Now!, and, through a joint venture with TVT/Nothing Records, the Nine Inch Nails EP Broken. However, Interscope's success with alternative and rock music was eclipsed by controversy which began in September 1992, when Vice President Dan Quayle called on Interscope to withdraw 2Pacalypse Now, stating that it was responsible for the death of a Texas state trooper, who was shot to death in April by a suspect who allegedly was listening to the album on the tape deck of a stolen truck when he was stopped by the officer.  The trooper's family filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope, claiming the record's violence-laden lyrics incite \"imminent lawless action\".[12][13]Earlier in 1992, Interscope negotiated a $10-million deal with Dr. Dre and Marion \"Suge\" Knight to finance and distribute their label, Death Row Records.  It was initiated by McClain, who met Dre when he was recording his solo debut, The Chronic. Original plans had called for the album to be released through Sony, but Sony passed on The Chronic  due to \"the crazy things going on around Death Row\" and the contractual status of Dr. Dre. After hearing the album, Iovine agreed to put it out, although doing so required a complicated distribution agreement with Priority Records, Dre's label as a member of N.W.A. The Chronic was released in December 1992.[14][15]By the end of the following year, The Chronic had sold almost 3\u00a0million copies. Snoop Dogg's debut Doggystyle had sold more than 800,000 copies in its first week alone, and Primus and 4 Non-Blondes had released records which hit the US Top 20.  In 1993, with an estimated gross of $90\u00a0million, Interscope became profitable ahead of projections.[16][17]Interscope further established its strength in the alternative and rock genres in 1994.  A $2.5\u00a0million investment to establish a joint venture with Trauma Records yielded three number-one Modern Rock tracks and a platinum-certified album with Bush's Sixteen Stone. The Nine Inch Nails album The Downward Spiral went to number two on the US charts and was widely acclaimed. Marilyn Manson's Portrait of an American Family, The Toadies album Rubberneck and Helmet's Betty were commercially successful and critically embraced.[18][19]In May 1995, the controversy related to gangsta rap and explicit lyrics intensified as U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole accused Interscope of releasing music that glorified violence and degraded women. Among others, the label was criticized by William J. Bennett, a former Education Secretary, and C. DeLores Tucker, the chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black Women.  In September, Time Warner announced it would disassociate itself from Interscope by selling its half-interest in the company to Field and Iovine for $115\u00a0million.[16][20]  Ownership in Interscope was aggressively pursued by EMI, BMG, PolyGram and MCA. On December 1, 1995, the Los Angeles Times noted that with five albums on that week's pop charts and sales of $350\u00a0million over the previous three years, \"what may have been a smart move politically for Time Warner is now looking like a financial fiasco.\"[21]   In February 1996, MCA Records\u2014then owned by Seagram\u2014bought 50% of Interscope for a reported $200\u00a0million.   Under the agreement, Interscope retained complete creative control over the label's recordings. MCA was not required to distribute material that it deemed offensive.[22]Dre left Death Row in mid-1996 due to what was then reported as tension over the creative direction of the label, and founded Aftermath Entertainment, a new joint venture with Interscope. In November that same year, Aftermath debuted with the album  Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath.  The Death Row deal remained in place until 1998, when Knight was imprisoned for parole violations.[23][24][25]In November 1996, with records by Bush, Snoop Dogg, No Doubt, and Tupac Shakur, Interscope became the first label in 20 years to hold the top 4 positions on the Billboard charts.  Six additional Interscope releases were in the Top 100.  The label was frequently criticized for overspending on artist acquisitions and joint ventures, however, with revenue for 1996 estimated at $250\u00a0million, it operated at a profit.[26]In 1996, MCA Music Entertainment was renamed Universal Music Group.  In 1998, the Universal Music Group parent company Seagram acquired PolyGram Records. MCA's Geffen Records and PolyGram's the A&M Records were merged into Interscope, and in early 1999, Interscope Records began operating under the umbrella of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, with Iovine and Field serving as co-chairmen.[27]Iovine's assistant (and former intern) Dean Geistlinger saw Eminem perform at the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles in 1997 and passed Eminem's CD on to Iovine; Iovine, in turn, passed it on to Dre.  In February 1999, Interscope and Aftermath released The Slim Shady LP.[28]  The album entered the charts at number two, and won two Grammy Awards.[29] Later in 1999 Eminem and his manager, Paul Rosenberg, founded Shady Records.[30]By the close of the decade, Interscope sales accounted for nearly one-third of Seagram's 27% share of the U.S. music market.   Records by Eminem, Dre, Eve, Nine Inch Nails, Enrique Iglesias, Limp Bizkit, Blackstreet, Smash Mouth and others generated an estimated $40\u00a0million in profit during the final six months of 1999.[31]Interscope/Shady released Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP on May 23, 2000. The fastest-selling rap album in history, it sold 1.76\u00a0million copies in its first week.[32]  In October, Limp Bizkit's 2000 album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water would shift 1.05 million copies in its first week in the United States, cementing Nu Metal's status in the pop culture as a top genre in the music industry at the time. Also Interscope began its relationship with U2 after it acquired the US rights to market and distribute the album All That You Can't Leave Behind.  Iovine had been trying to sign U2 since 1990.[4]In 2001, Field resigned as co-chairman of Interscope to start a new label.[33] Described as an amicable parting,  Field said he was \"anxious to become an entrepreneur again.\"  An agreement with Universal allowed Field to resign a year before his contract was set to expire.[34][35]   Conversely, Whalley, Interscope's president since 1998, accepted the position of chairman of Warner Bros. Records in May 2000 and was not released from his Interscope contract until it expired in August 2001.[36]Interscope/Shady released The Eminem Show, in May 2002 and the soundtrack for Eminem's semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile in October; the two titles combined sold more than 11,000,000 records before the end of the year.[37][38] In February 2003, Shady/Aftermath/Interscope had another record-breaking hit with Get Rich or Die Tryin', the debut album by 50 Cent. It sold 872,000 units in five days.[39]  In April, it was announced that 50 Cent would sign and develop artists for release on G-Unit Records, which would be marketed and distributed through Interscope.[40]In November 2003, Universal Music Group acquired DreamWorks Records and in 2004 it was merged into Interscope Geffen A&M.  The DreamWorks A&R staff was retained, and the label's artists were divided between Geffen and Interscope. Among others,  Interscope inherited Blink-182, The All-American Rejects, and Nelly Furtado.[41]In March 2005, Interscope launched Cherrytree Records with Martin Kierszenbaum, its head of international operations. Kierszenbaum, also a producer and A&R executive, focused initially on developing artists from outside the United States. Feist and Robyn were among Cherrytree's first artists.[42][43]Four of Interscope's releases were in the top 10 of the year end sales charts in 2005: The Massacre (50 Cent) at number one, Encore (Eminem) at number two, Love.Angel.Music.Baby. (Gwen Stefani) at number six, and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (U2) at number eight. The Game's The Documentary appeared at number 16, and The Black Eyed Peas album Monkey Business charted at number 18.[44]In 2006, Dre and Iovine established Beats Electronics.  Dre had been approached by his attorney to start a line of sneakers, and when he told Iovine about the idea, Iovine said: \"You know speakers, not sneakers.\"  'Beats by Dr. Dre Studio Headphones' were introduced in January 2008 at the annual Consumer Electronics Show. \"It took us two years to get them right, but when I heard I knew it was going to be big,\" Iovine said in 2010. \"It's just like listening to a hit record.\"  The marketing for Beats integrated endorsements from Interscope artists including Gwen Stefani, M.I.A. and Pharrell, Lady Gaga, and will.i.am.\n[45][46]Lady Gaga's studio debut The Fame was released in August 2008; it was re-released with eight new songs as The Fame Monster in November 2009. Interscope held the top four positions on the 2009 year-end Hot 100 charts with The Black Eyed Peas' \"Boom Boom Pow\" (number one) and \"I Gotta Feeling\" (number four); Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\" charted at number two and \"Just Dance\" was at number three.[47]In June 2010 Eminem's Recovery entered the Billboard 200 at number one, his sixth album to do so.

Rodrigo signed to Geffen Records, a subsidiary of Interscope Records, intending to release her debut EP in 2021.[2]When I came up with 'Drivers License', I was going through a heartbreak that was so confusing to me, so multifaceted. Putting all those feelings into a song made everything seem so much simpler and clearer\u2014and at the end of the day, I think that's the whole purpose of songwriting. There\u2019s nothing like sitting at the piano in my bedroom and writing a really sad song. It\u2019s truly my favorite thing in the world.She teased the song for many months in 2020,[3] including some lyrics on Instagram.[4] She posted a snippet, captioned \"Wrote dis the other day. vv close to my heart. gonna call it drivers license I think lol\", where she plays the song on a piano.[5] The song was announced on January 4.[6] The song was released to all digital music and streaming platforms four days later, alongside a music video on YouTube.[7] It is the lead single to her debut studio album Sour, which Rodrigo had originally planned to be an EP.[5] \"Drivers License\" impacted US contemporary hit radio on January 19.[8]Steered by piano, \"Drivers License\" is an atmospheric power ballad,[9] that has been described as a bedroom pop,[10] indie pop,[11] and power pop song,[12] with elements of folk and indie rock.[11] It was inspired by the disorienting emotions Rodrigo felt after a recent breakup.[3][2] She wrote the song with its producer, Daniel Nigro.[1] The song is written in the key of B\u266d major and has a fast tempo of 144 beats per minute, with double time kick drum and claps on the second  verse and lead-in.[13] Rodrigo's vocal range on the song spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of F5.[14] Lyrically, the song has Rodrigo drive through a suburban area, upset and angry, pondering whether any of the subject's feelings were ever true.[15]The song begins with the sound of Rodrigo's mother's car[citation needed] engine starting, followed by a \"door ajar\" chime that fades into a pulsing piano key. Rodrigo delivers soprano vocals that grow into \"cathartic howls of pain\" as the song progresses, along with a swelling crescendo followed by an emotional chorus.[11] The minimalist instrumentation[11] also consists of syncopated hand-claps and stomping harmonies, and reaches its peak in a rich bridge of layered vocals with the catchphrase \"I still fuckin' love you\".[16][15][12] As stated by Rodrigo, the song has Lorde and Taylor Swift influences,[17] which was also noted by critics.[18] Rodrigo also stated that the EP Minor (2020) by American singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams inspired the musical style of \"Drivers License\".[19]In an interview with Vogue magazine, Rodrigo acknowledged the song had grammatical errors, including the lack of an apostrophe (\"Drivers License\" vs \"Driver's License\") and the contradictory double negative: \"I've never felt this way for no one\".[20]\"Drivers License\" received universal acclaim from critics upon its release.[11][21] Clash critic Robin Murray dubbed the song a \"sensational pop statement, an impeccable melodic moment right from the off\".

Dodson thought the song channels \"the songwriting prowess she already brings to the table\".[9] Naming it one of the \"10 Cool New Pop Songs to Get You Through The Week\", Billboard writers Gab Linsberg and Jason Lipshutz branded \"Drivers License\" the type of debut single \"that aspiring artists dream of\", where Rodrigo perfects her heartbreak's \"fragility and heightened emotion\".

She receives her driver's license in the video, but instead of going to her old lover's house like she used to dream of, she finds herself aimlessly cruising suburban side streets. Rodrigo reminisces about moments from her brief relationship. At the beginning of the video, she is embraced by the happy memories only, but eventually, all the toxic traits of her ex-partner confront her. The video received positive comments from critics for its visuals.[24][3]As of March 2022, the song has 350 million views on YouTube.When we were talking about the audience that [Rodrigo] had prior to the release\u2014that's a very young, female, engaged audience. So they really sort of sparked the flame. But now what you have is it traveling well beyond that audience. And obviously social media platforms have helped that, but I think just word of mouth. This is a song you're talking about with everyone right now. Everyone's listening to it, everyone's obsessing over it.\"Drivers License\" has been credited with launching Rodrigo's music career.[66] The instant commercial success of the song upon its release has been attributed to the rise of niche market for bedroom pop, the song's emotional lyricism and appeal, TikTok, the tabloid journalism and social media speculation surrounding the song, and Rodrigo's Disney career. The Indian Express opined that song is a part of the DIY movement in the music industry, where young artists (mostly post-millennials), such as Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, and Tate McRae, are capable of making music of \"near-studio quality\" without leaving the house.[10] Commenting on the song's unprecedented success, Spotify's Becky Bass stated that \"We've never seen anything like this, where you do have a newer artist that just comes out of the gate in such a dominant way, and just continues to grow\".[65]Paper remarked that the song is a \"product of years of pop trends\" that resonates with millions of listeners, similar to the rise of Eilish in 2019, Lorde in 2013, or Taylor Swift in the late 2000s, but occurred instantly in Rodrigo's case, because of recent technological innovations like TikTok that has altered the course of the music industry. The TikTok hashtag \"#driverslicense\" amassed over 888.5 million views in one week. Paper also highlighted consumers' interest in the song's romantic background (a phenomenon of listeners being invested in the drama between Disney co-stars) as a factor for the song's success.[67] The New York Times writer Joe Coscarelli wrote that the song was spurred not only by its quality, but also the gossips surrounding it, paired with the label's marketing plan, and support from celebrities like Swift. He noted the autobiographical song bolstered tabloids and listeners to \"piece together its real-life parallels\", while TikTok videos led to social media posts, \"which led to streams, which led to news articles, and back around again\", generating an \"unbeatable\" feedback loop. Coscarelli added that, similar to Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, and Selena Gomez, Rodrigo took \"her experiences within the Disney machine and attempted to translate them for a broader, more adult audience\".[68]Stereogum's Chris DeVille found Rodrigo to be an example of \"actor-turned-pop stars\" who profit off their best-known roles, such as her Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which \"created a massive built-in audience for a prospective Rodrigo music career\"; \"Drivers License\" maximized this interest by referencing the \"behind-the-scenes drama\" involving Joshua Bassett, who co-stars with Rodrigo in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and Sabrina Carpenter. DeVille added that the song \"will have ripple effects\" that affect the industry in 2021 and beyond, as its bedroom pop sound is challenging hip-hop's dominance on streaming platforms.[11] Douglas Greenwood, writing for I-D, asserted that \"Drivers License\" contains \"all of the old-school ingredients of a hit\".[69]Insider dubbed the song an \"early 2021 cultural touchstone\", citing its \"sad girl appeal\" echoing Generation Z (similar to Lorde and Eilish), the celebrity romance associated with its lyrics (like that of Swift), the song's cinematic bridge, its TikTok popularity, and radio friendliness as contributing factors to the song's success.[70] Music journalist Laura Snapes, writing for The Guardian, wrote \"Drivers License\" is the \"epitome of new-school pop songwriting\", in which power ballads are sonically intimate and subdued, rather than bombastic, with lyrics delving into specific and complex emotions.[71] The February 20, 2021 episode of Saturday Night Live included a skit in which English actor Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and six other male cast members recited the song's lyrics.[72] Responding to the tabloid speculation around the song's subjects, Rodrigo stated: \"I put it out not knowing that it would get that reaction, so it was really strange [when] it did. I just remember [everyone being] so weird and speculative about stuff they had no idea about. I don't really subscribe to hating other women because of boys. I think that's so stupid, and I really resent that narrative that was being tossed around.\"[72]\"Drivers License\" was featured as the main music for Google's Year in Search commercial for 2021.[73]Credits adapted from the liner notes of Sour.[1]Studio locationsPersonnelSales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\u00a0 Streaming-only figures based on certification alone.",

It was kept off of the top spot by Rodrigo's follow-up single, \"Good 4 U\".In the United Kingdom, the single debuted at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart after its first full tracking week.[28] Following the release of its parent album, the song reached a new peak of number 4 on the chart.[29] In Ireland, \"Deja Vu\" reached number two on its Irish Singles Chart.[30]In Australia, \"Deja Vu\" launched at number 13 after its first full tracking week,[31] then climbed to number 6 three weeks after, scoring Rodrigo her second top 10 song in the country.[32] Upon Sour's release, \"Deja Vu\" reached a new peak of number 3.[33]Before \"Deja Vu\" was released, Rodrigo went onto YouTube and MTV for premiering her new single, and said that they shot the music video of \"Deja Vu\" in Malibu. The music video was directed by Allie Avital.[34] It featured an appearance by actress Talia Ryder.[35] The video first depicts Olivia after getting her drivers license, with her right hand holding ice cream and her left hand on the steering wheel, as she drives up the Pacific Coast Highway to a house. Another girl flashes in the rear-view mirror. At the house, she peers in the window, and smiles at the girl inside who is wearing a green dress, apparently reminiscing. Olivia drives back to her home and puts on the same green dress. She goes into a room with many TVs stacked up on each other, playing VHS tapes of her memories being reenacted by the girl she just saw. Eventually, the girl turns to the camera and waves at Olivia who realizes she was being used by her ex-boyfriend to replace the other girl all along. In a rage, Olivia proceeds to smash the TVs with a hammer except one showing the other girl in the car lip-syncing the words, \"I know you get deja vu.\" The end scene shows the beginning scene except the other girl is driving and not Olivia.[36][37]As of January 2022, the song has 200 million views on YouTube.Credits adapted from the liner notes of Sour[38] and Tidal.[18]Studio locationsPersonnelSales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\u00a0 Streaming-only figures based on certification alone.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Good_4_U": "\"Good 4 U\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, released on May 14, 2021, through Geffen and Interscope Records, as the third single from Rodrigo's debut studio album, Sour (2021). The song was announced on May 10 via Rodrigo's social media. It was written by Rodrigo and its producer Dan Nigro; Hayley Williams and Josh Farro were given co-writing credits due to inspiration from Paramore's \"Misery Business\" (2007).Musically, \"Good 4 U\" has been described as an upbeat song blending rock, pop, punk, grunge, emo, and alternative styles. It consists of a staccato bassline, energetic electric guitars, and explosive drumming, with lyrics addressing a former lover who moved on very quickly after a breakup. The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised the instrumentation reminiscent of the 1990s\u20132000s and Rodrigo's crisp songwriting. The accompanying music video features Rodrigo as a cheerleader exacting revenge, visually alluding to the 1990s and 2000s' cult classic films Audition, The Princess Diaries, and Jennifer's Body. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, \"Good 4 U\" received a nomination for Best Music Video.The single reached number one in 23 countries including Australia, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States; it was the second chart-topping single from Sour in many of those countries, following Rodrigo's debut single \"Drivers License\" (2021). \"Good 4 U\" peaked within the top 10 in more than 20 territories. It has received platinum or multi-platinum certifications globally.Rodrigo announced her debut studio album Sour on April 1, 2021.[3] \"Good 4 U\" placed sixth on the track listing.[4] On May 10, Rodrigo announced via her social media accounts that \"Good 4 U\" would become the third single from Sour on May 14, following \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\". Alongside the announcement, she also revealed the song's cover artwork.[5][6] Rodrigo had previously teased the song in a promotional image for \"Deja Vu\".[7]In her August 2021 Variety cover story, Rodrigo stated she came up with the song's hook in the shower. She added she did not want the entirety of Sour to be \"sad piano songs\", but also did not want to write a happy, \"I'm in love\" pop song, because \"that was so far from how [she] was truly feeling at the time\". Rodrigo concluded that \"Good 4 U\" was \"really satisfying\" due to its upbeat energy and danceability without sacrificing honesty and authenticity in her lyrics.[8]\"Good 4 U\" is an electro-tinged[9] rock,[10] pop-punk,[11] pop rock,[12] grunge,[13] teen pop,[14] and an emo[15] song with alternative influences.[16] Its instrumentation is driven by a set of 1990s-inspired electric guitars and bass.[16] Its verses follow a rhythm typical of R&B.[17] The song was written by Rodrigo and Daniel Nigro, and produced by Nigro and Alexander 23.[16] In August 2021, Paramore members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro received writing credits, as the chorus was inspired by Paramore's 2007 song \"Misery Business\".[2] This proved to be controversial as many disputed the plagiarism claim, citing them as being two completely different songs with some similarities.[18][19][20] Rodrigo later responded, discussing her feelings about Williams and Farro being added as co-writers on \"Good 4 U\":\"I think it's disappointing to see people take things out of context and discredit any young woman's work. But at the end of the day, I'm just really proud and happy to say that my job is being a songwriter. All music is inspired by each other. Obviously, I write all of my lyrics from my heart and my life first. I came up with the lyrics and the melody for 'Good 4 U' one morning in the shower. What's so beautiful about music is that it can be so inspired by music that's come out in the past. Every single artist is inspired by artists who have come before them. It's sort of a fun, beautiful sharing process. Nothing in music is ever new. There's four chords in every song. That's the fun part \u2014 trying to make that your own.\"[21]The song begins with an \"uncluttered five-note\"[10] staccato bass line and Rodrigo's vocals delivered in a soft tone, which is then joined by an energetic guitar, using a chorus effect, before dropping into the drums-driven chorus. The second verse returns to the original bass line with added \"lilting\" drum beats and backup harmonies, and slowly ascends to Rodrigo's \"near-shout\" vocal delivery.[16]In \"Good 4 U,\" Rodrigo confronts her ex who has moved on very quickly from the relationship with her, using plentiful sarcastic remarks and singing, \"Well, good for you / You look happy and healthy, not me / If you ever cared to ask / Good for you / You're doin' great out there without me, baby / God, I wish that I could do that / I've lost my mind, I've spent the night / Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom / But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it / But I guess good for you.\" It marks a departure from Rodrigo's preceding singles, \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\", which presented a melancholic and slower emotion.[22]\"Good 4 U\" received positive reviews from music critics.[10] People's Tom\u00e1s Mier has described the song as a \"heartbreak track filled with an angsty pop-rock sound.\"[23] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone lauded Rodrigo's musical versatility, and noted influences from Taylor Swift in \"Good 4 U\".[14] Variety critic Ellise Shaffer dubbed the song a \"nostalgic heartbreak anthem\" evoking a \"fluttering, cathartic feeling reminiscent of late '90s Hole or early Paramore, but with a poppier flair\".[16] Teen Vogue's Claire Dodson said that \"Good 4 U\" gives \"pure 2000s pop-punk\" aside Rodrigo's \"knockout songwriting\". Dodson found Rodrigo's voice versatile, easily moving between styles similar to Swift's vocals in \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), and that of Alanis Morissette and Hayley Williams, to become \"something original\".[24] Sydney Bucksbaum, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the single a \"pop-punk breakup anthem\" and an \"immediate banger\", underlining the song's similarities to Paramore's \"Misery Business\" (2007).[25] In agreement, Halle Kiefer of Vulture also named the song an \"angry track\" evocative of \"Misery Business\" in \"the best possible way\".[26] In a critique of its genre, Slate's Chris Molanphy said \"Good 4 U\" is a \"snarling rock number\" inspired by the 2000s, adding that it \"not really rock-slash-anything. It isn't alt-rock crossed with SoundCloud rap like the recent chart-topper 'Mood' by 24kGoldn and Iann Dior, isn't guitar-based trap-pop \u00e0 la Post Malone, isn't indie-rock with bedroom-pop hooks \u00e0 la Taylor Swift's recent creations.\"[10]In the United States, \"Good 4 U\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, giving Rodrigo her second number-one song in the country, following her eight-week chart-topper \"Drivers License\". Sour became the first debut album in history to have two of its songs debut at number one on the Hot 100, as well as the third album by a female artist to spawn two number-one debuts on the Hot 100. \"Good 4 U\" was also the third consecutive single from the album to debut in the top 10 of the chart. The song drew 43.2 million U.S. streams and sold 12,000 downloads in its first week of release. The track debuted atop the Streaming Songs chart as Rodrigo's second leader and ruling for seven consecutive weeks, after \"Drivers License\" ruled for four weeks, and started at number five on the Billboard Digital Songs chart.[41] \"Good 4 U\" dropped to number two in its second week and held that rank for eleven non-consecutive weeks, becoming the first song since Whitney Houston's \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" (1995\u201396) to spend eleven weeks at number two on the Hot 100.[42]In the United Kingdom, \"Good 4 U\" was also a commercial success. The song accumulated over 1 million streams in its first three days in the United Kingdom.[43] The song debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, marking Rodrigo's second top-10 song and third top-20 song in the country. In its second week, the song topped the chart, becoming Rodrigo's second number-one single after \"Drivers License\".[44] \"Good 4 U\" became one of the biggest chart-topping singles in the UK in 2021, gathering more than 117,000 units sold in its second week, including 13.5 million streams, to reach number one.[45] It topped the charts for five consecutive weeks, in the fourth of which it became the first rock song to reach such a feat since Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\" (2003).[46] In its seventh week, the song was dethroned by Ed Sheeran's \"Bad Habits\" dropping down to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart.[47] After ten weeks within the top ten on the UK Charts, \"Good 4 U\" dropped out of the top ten charting at number 12.[48] \"Good 4 U\" spent a total of 25 weeks inside the UK Top 40 in 2021.[49] At the end of the year, it was reported that \"Good 4 U\" had been streamed a total of 167 million times in the UK as well as being the second biggest song in the UK in 2021 by selling 1,390,000 copies.[50]Elsewhere, In Ireland \"Good 4 U\" scored Rodrigo's second number-one song on the Official Irish Singles Chart, following \"Drivers License\". With this, all singles from Sour had entered the top 10 of the chart.[51] The song spent five consecutive weeks at number one in Ireland.[52] \"Good 4 U\" further topped the singles chart in New Zealand[53] and Singapore. In Australia, \"Good 4 U\" debuted at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart, after which it rose to number one upon the impact of Sour.[54] \"Good 4 U\" spent six consecutive weeks at number one in Australia.[55]British rock magazine Kerrang! stated that \"Good 4 U\" leads the commercial comeback of rock music in 2020\u20132021, noting how it is the first rock record since Evanescence's 2003 single \"Bring Me to Life\" to spend four or more weeks atop the UK Singles chart, alongside chart success of other rock-adjacent artists, such as Willow Smith, Machine Gun Kelly, M\u00e5neskin, and Miley Cyrus.[15] Slate admired Rodrigo's versatility and proclaimed that she \"might be the dying genre's best hope\", pinpointing that \"Good 4 U\" is the \"most up-the-middle rock song to top the [U.S.] Hot 100 in a decade or more\".[10]An accompanying music video directed by Petra Collins was released alongside the song on May 14, 2021.[56] The music video references horror films such as Audition (1999) and Jennifer's Body (2009). Rodrigo was styled by vlogger Devon Carlson for the video. In the video, Rodrigo appears in a variety of looks, including a cheerleading uniform seen in 2001 coming-of-age film The Princess Diaries (also seen in the cover artwork).[57] She plays the role of a high schooler out for revenge,[58] destroying her ex-boyfriend's bedroom and lighting his belongings on fire.[22] Insider critic Callie Ahlgrim opined that the fire was a reference to Swift's music video for \"Picture to Burn\" (2008), which also follows a similar revengeful concept.[59]As of May 2022, the song has 365 million views on YouTube.Rodrigo performed \"Good 4 U\" for the first time on May 15, 2021, along with \"Drivers License\", on Saturday Night Live.[60][61] On September 12, Rodrigo performed the song at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards.[62] An orchestral-arranged version of the song was performed by Rodrigo on her documentary film Driving Home 2 U: A Sour Film, released on March 25, 2022 for Disney+.\"Singles 4 U\" vinyl single[63]Credits adapted from the liner notes of Sour.[1]Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\u00a0 Streaming-only figures based on certification alone.",

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/White_House": "The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers.The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban[3] in the neoclassical style. Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800, using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.[4]  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion (Executive Residence), the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. The East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing walls and wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was constructed inside the walls. On the exterior, the Truman Balcony was added. Once the structural work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, the West Wing, the East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president) and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories: the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second[5] on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\".Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the Franklin House and owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3\u00a0Cherry Street, through late February 1790.[6][7]  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the Alexander Macomb House at 39\u201341 Broadway[7] where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, Government House.[8] Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in December 1790.[8]The July 1790 Residence Act designated the capital be permanently located in the new Federal District, and temporarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for ten years while the permanent capital was built.[9] Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant Robert Morris at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the President's House, which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.[10]  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people who made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.[10]President John Adams also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.[11]The President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores, before being demolished in 1832.[10]Philadelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it, saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the University of Pennsylvania in 1800.[12]First Presidential Mansion: Samuel Osgood House, Manhattan, New York. Occupied by Washington: April 1789\u00a0\u2013 February 1790.Second Presidential Mansion: Alexander Macomb House, Manhattan, New York. Occupied by Washington: February\u2013August 1790.Third Presidential Mansion: President's House, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Occupied by Washington: November 1790\u00a0\u2013 March 1797. Occupied by Adams: March 1797\u00a0\u2013 May 1800.Government House, Manhattan, New York (1790\u20131791). Built to be the permanent presidential mansion, Congress moved the national capital to Philadelphia before its completion.House intended for the President, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1790s). Built to be the permanent presidential mansion, it was not used by any president.The President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's[a] 1791 plan for the newly established federal city of Washington, D.C.[13] Washington and his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House and the Capitol would be chosen in a design competition.[14]Although all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by James Hoban was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.[15]Hoban was born in Ireland and trained at the Dublin Society of Arts. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in South Carolina, where he designed several buildings, including the state capitol in Columbia. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.[16]President Washington visited Charleston, South Carolina, in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction Charleston County Courthouse designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.[17]On July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.[18]The building has classical inspiration sources that can be found in the styles of the Roman architect Vitruvius and the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio; Palladio being an Italian architect of the Renaissance whose style evolved into Palladian architecture, which became popular in North America in the 18th century. Hoban's design is influenced by the upper floors of Leinster House, in Dublin, which later became the seat of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament).[19] Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present Blue Room. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in White House Historical Association publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac, a neoclassical country house located in La Bachellerie in the Dordogne region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the French Revolution for twenty years, and then finally built between 1812 and 1817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).[20] The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of the connection posit that Thomas Jefferson, during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the college) at the \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture (Bordeaux Architectural College).[21]  On his return to the US he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and Benjamin Henry Latrobe.[20]Though there is no record of a formal ceremony,[b] construction of the White House began at noon on October 13, 1792, with the laying of the cornerstone.[23] The main residence, as well as the foundations of the house, were built largely by enslaved and free African-American laborers, as well as employed Europeans.[24] Much of the other work on the house was done by immigrants, many of them without citizenship yet. The sandstone walls were erected by Scottish immigrants, employed by Hoban,[25] as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the Croatian island of Bra\u010d (specifically the Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a quarry whose stone was used to build the ancient Diocletian's Palace in Split) was used in the original construction of the building. However, researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia, as importing the stone would be too costly.[26][27][28] The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equivalent to $3,710,000 in 2021). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.[29]Shortages of material and labor forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.[25] The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were whitewashed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.[25]The north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet, thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be on two floors. The central three bays are behind a prostyle portico (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830), serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a porte cochere. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while at second-floor level, the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a lunette fanlight. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral festoon. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.The mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the Palladian and neoclassical styles of architecture. It consists of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is rusticated in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projected bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground-floor double staircase leading to an Ionic colonnaded loggia (with the Truman Balcony at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.The building was originally variously referred to as the President's Palace, Presidential Mansion, or President's House.[30] The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.[31] A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,[32] giving the building its namesake hue.[33] The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.[34][35] The current letterhead wording and arrangement of \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath it dates to the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[35]Although the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have been derived from Martha Washington's home, White House Plantation, in Virginia, where the nation's first president courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.[36]On Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building.[25] The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"[37] \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.[37]Adams lived in the house only briefly before Thomas Jefferson moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"[38] in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"),[39] Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With Benjamin Henry Latrobe, he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.[25] Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.[25]In 1814, during the War of 1812, the White House was set ablaze by British troops[40] during the Burning of Washington, in retaliation for attacking and burning Toronto (then called York),[41] Port Dover and other towns in Upper Canada; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only three have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,[40], in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington, and, also in 1939, a medicine chest that had belonged to President Madison was returned by the descendants of a British naval officer.[42][43] Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by HMS Fantome sank en route to Halifax off Prospect during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,[44][45] even though Fantome had no involvement in that action.[46]After the fire, President James Madison resided in the Octagon House from 1814 to 1815, and then in the Seven Buildings from 1815 to the end of his term.[47] Meanwhile, both Hoban and Latrobe contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south portico was constructed in 1824 during the James Monroe administration; the north portico was built six years later.[25] Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.[48] An elliptical portico at Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac in La Bachellerie, France, with nearly identical curved stairs, is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,[49] although this matter is one of great debate.[50] Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the U.S. Capitol, carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the Viceregal Lodge (now \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, residence of the president of Ireland), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.[49] For the North Portico, a variation on the Ionic Order was devised, incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814Jefferson and Latrobe's West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.Principal story plan for the White House by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, 1807Earliest known photograph of the White House, taken c. 1846 by John Plumbe during the administration of James K. PolkBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions, was questioned.[51] Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked with proposing solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence, and he designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C. Congress, however, rejected the plan.[51] Another option was Metropolis View, which is now the campus of The Catholic University of America.[52]When Chester A. Arthur took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed Lucretia Garfield moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. Louis Comfort Tiffany was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a public auction.[53] All that was saved were bust portraits of John Adams and Martin Van Buren.[54] A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.In the fall of 1882, work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of gold leaf, and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, with colorful traceries woven to spell \"USA.\" The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled Tiffany glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.[55][56]In 1891, First Lady Caroline Harrison proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.[51] A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham that reflected the Harrison proposal.[51] These plans were ultimately rejected.However, in 1902, Theodore Roosevelt hired McKim, Mead & White to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.[57][58] Charles McKim himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.[25]President William Howard Taft enlisted the help of architect Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the Oval Office.[51]  In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.[59]:\u200a17\u200a The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; Herbert Hoover and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930.[60] \nIn the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the Rose Garden.[25]Decades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth-story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S. Truman[61] took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.[25] By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951.[62] The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame, and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.[61] The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7\u00a0million ($60 million in 2021).[63] Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.[61] Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.[25] The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.[25] While the Truman reconstruction preserved the house's structure, much of the new interior finishes were generic and of little historic significance. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.[64]Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.[65] Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements from the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family.St\u00e9phane Boudin of the House of Jansen, a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.[65] Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the Green Room, French Empire for the Blue Room, American Empire for the Red Room, Louis XVI for the Yellow Oval Room, and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the Treaty Room. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.[65] In the Diplomatic Reception Room, Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which Zuber & Cie had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.The first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.[66] Sales of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.In a televised tour of the house on Valentine's Day in 1962, Kennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public.[67]Congress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum. Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.[59]:\u200a29Out of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.[68] Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the Committee for the Preservation of the White House must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally-authorized committee works with each First Family\u00a0\u2013 usually represented by the first lady, the White House curator, and the chief usher\u00a0\u2013 to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.[69]During the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady Pat Nixon refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President Richard Nixon.[70] Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.[71] Her husband created the modern press briefing room over Franklin Roosevelt's old swimming pool.[72] Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.[73]Computers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.[74] A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.[75][76] Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.[77] The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.[77]In the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton refurbished some rooms with the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.[78] During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.[78]The White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness. In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton, at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.In 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.[76] These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. One hundred sixty-seven solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.[79] In 2013, President Barack Obama had a set of solar panels installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.[80][81]Today the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing. The Chief Usher coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes six stories and 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater[82]), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.[35] It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.[83]The original residence is in the center. Two colonnades\u00a0\u2013 one on the east and one on the west\u00a0\u2013 designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase.[84] The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices.[85] The second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President's Dining Room, the Treaty Room, Lincoln Bedroom and Queens' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.[86] The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).[87]The West Wing houses the president's office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets,[88] as well as the White House Situation Room, James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, and Roosevelt Room.[89] In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs.[90] The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8\u00a0million, out of which news outlets paid $2\u00a0million.[90] In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.[91]Some members of the president's staff are located in the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which was, until 1999, called the Old Executive Office Building and was historically the State War and Navy building.[90]The Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a sound stage and used as the setting for The West Wing television show.[92]The East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the first lady and the White House Social Office. Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.The White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, the grading and planting of which was ordered by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.[93][94] Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[95] In 2020, First Lady Melania Trump redesigned the Rose Garden.The Cross Hall, connecting the State Dining Room and the East Room on the State FloorMarine One prepares to land on the South Lawn, where State Arrival Ceremonies are held.View from the south, with south fountainView from the north, with north fountainWhite House at night, view from the northLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey.[96] Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Inspired by Washington's open houses in New York and Philadelphia, John Adams began the tradition of the White House New Year's Reception.[97] Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of an annual reception on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.In February 1974, a stolen army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House's grounds.[98] Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by Frank Eugene Corder crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.[99]As a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.[100]On May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.After September 11, 2001, this change was made permanent, in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and the Ellipse.[101] In response to the Boston Marathon bombing, the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.The Pennsylvania Avenue closure has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.[102]Prior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the Old Executive Office Building to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk[clarification needed] served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.[103] Due to budget constraints, White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to sequestration.[104] The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.[105]The White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.During the 2005 presidential inauguration, NASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) units were used to patrol the airspace over Washington, D.C. The same units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.[106][107]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Murrieta,_California": "Murrieta /m\u028a\u0259ri\u02c8\u025bt\u0259/ is a city in southwestern Riverside County, California, United States. The population of Murrieta was 110,949 as of the 2020 census.[6] Murrieta experienced a 133.7% population increase between 2000 and 2010, making Murrieta one of the fastest-growing cities in the state during that period. Largely residential in character, Murrieta is typically characterized as a bedroom community. Murrieta is bordered by the city of Temecula to the south, the cities of Menifee and Wildomar to the north, and the unincorporated community of French Valley to the east. Murrieta is located in the center of the Los Angeles-San Diego mega-region. Murrieta is named for Juan Murrieta, a Californio ranchero who founded the town.[7]For most of its history, Murrieta was not heavily populated. On June 9, 1873,[8] Domingo Pujol, Francisco Sanjurjo, and Juan and Ezequiel Murrieta purchased the Rancho Pauba and Rancho Temecula Mexican land grants, comprising 52,000 acres (210\u00a0km2) in the area. Ezequiel returned to Spain and turned the land over to his younger brother, Juan Murrieta (1844\u20131936), who brought 7,000 sheep[9] to the valley in 1873, using the meadows to feed his sheep. The partnership dissolved in 1876 and Ezequiel and Juan Murrieta retained 15,000 acres of the northern half of the Temecula Rancho.[10] Ezequiel and Juan Murrieta granted a right-of-way, one hundred feet wide to the California Southern Railroad through the Temecula Rancho on April 28, 1882 so that the railroad could be constructed through the valley.[11]In 1884, the Temecula Land and Water Company purchased about 14,500 acres from Juan Murrieta and mapped a townsite along the California Southern Railroad.[12] Others discovered the valley after the construction of a depot in 1887[13] that connected Murrieta to the Southern California Railroad's transcontinental route. By 1890, some 800 people lived in Murrieta.[14] Today much of the site (about 50 acres) is home to a Bible college and conference center, owned by Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, which has invested millions of dollars into restoring and rebuilding the old resort rooms.[15] When the trains stopped in 1935, tourists\u2014the lifeblood of the town\u2014were much harder to come by. The boom that Murrieta had experienced due to the train and the hot springs gradually died, leaving Murrieta as a small country town.[16]Although US Route 395 passed through Murrieta, it was not until Interstate 15 was built in the early 1980s that another boom began to take hold. By the late 1980s, suburban neighborhoods were being constructed, and people began moving to the Murrieta area from cities and towns in San Diego and Orange Counties, as well as other parts of Riverside County.[17]In 1990, residents began a campaign for city status which resulted in the incorporation of the City of Murrieta on July 1, 1991. By then the population was 24,000, a major increase from 2,200 in 1980. Between 1991 and 2007, the city's population further increased to an estimated 97,257 residents, and at the 2010 United States Census[update] the city's population was 103,466, making it the largest city in southwestern Riverside County at that time.[14]In July 2014, Murrieta garnered national attention following days of citizen protests of detained immigrants.[18]\nMurrieta residents successfully blocked busloads of illegal immigrant detainees.[19] They were en route to a temporary relocation and detention facility, which the federal government had planned to establish in the town.[20]Murrieta is located at 33\u00b034\u203210\u2033N 117\u00b012\u20329\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff33.56944\u00b0N 117.20250\u00b0W\ufeff / 33.56944; -117.20250 (33.569566, -117.202453).[21] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (87.1\u00a0km2), of which 99.89% of it is land and 0.11% is covered by water. Murrieta Creek runs southeasterly through the Murrieta Valley.Murrieta has a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer subtropical (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Murrieta has an average of 263 sunshine days and 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.[23] April through November is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of 77\u201391\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u201333\u00a0\u00b0C) and lows of 44\u201360\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u201316\u00a0\u00b0C). The period of November through March is somewhat rainy. The city is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate: temperatures can vary as much as 18\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient over 1\u00a0\u00b0F per mile (0.3\u00a0\u00b0C/km) from the coast inland. Murrieta gets on average 31 days a year of some type of precipitation. Murrieta averages 15 inches (380 millimetres) of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April) with generally light rain showers, but sometimes heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Snowfall is rare in the city basin, but nearby mountains slopes typically receive snowfall each winter.[citation needed]The 2010 United States Census[26] reported that Murrieta had a population of 103,466.

Historic U.S. Route 395 passes through the city's downtown and State Route 79 (Winchester Road) defines much of the city's eastern border. The Riverside Transit Agency provides bus routes connecting in several areas of the city.[35] Proposals currently exist that may position the city to play host to the high-speed rail (HSR) that voters approved in 2008 with Prop 1A.[36] This active HSR station is projected to handle 8,000 daily riders. The program-level HSR route alignment has placed this station between Murrieta and Temecula near the I-15 and I-215 freeway interchange.[37]The French Valley Airport, located just east of the city limits, is the largest general aviation airport in southwest Riverside County.[38]Murrieta had an all-volunteer fire department for almost 39 years. In 1987, it became a full-fledged municipal fire protection district, the only one in southwestern Riverside County. The Murrieta Fire Department also has been the primary paramedic service provider for the city since 2000. In 2017, the department changed their name to Murrieta Fire and Rescue. As of 2022, the department has 5 stations throughout the city, and operates a primary fleet of four type-1 engines, one quint-style truck, and two type-6 engines. The engines and truck are typically operated with a crew of 3 (one Captain, one Engineer, and one Firefighter/Paramedic), while the type-6 engines are typically operated with a crew of two (one Engineer and one Firefighter/Paramedic) and are referred to as Medic Patrol units.The Murrieta Police Department was created in 1992, with the encouragement of Riverside County Sheriff Cois Byrd; it remained the only municipal police department in southwestern Riverside County until the creation of the Menifee Police Department in 2020. As of 2022, the department had about 100 sworn officers and approximately 50 support staff, and is headed by Chief of Police Tony Conrad.Murrieta is the safest city in Riverside County,[39] and in 2009, Murrieta was listed as the second-safest city (over 100,000 in population) in the United States, behind Irvine, California.Murrieta is served by two hospitals: Loma Linda University Medical Center and Rancho Springs Medical Center. Kaiser Permanente, which is planning to open a hospital, has offices in the northeastern part of the city.[40]The city of Murrieta is served by the Murrieta Valley Unified School District (MVUSD). The district contains eleven elementary (K-5) schools, four middle (6-8) schools, three comprehensive high (9-12) schools (Murrieta Valley High School, Vista Murrieta High School, Murrieta Mesa High School), one continuation school (Creekside High School), and one independent study school. Because of the explosive growth in the area, an additional elementary school, middle school, and high school have been proposed. Murrieta Mesa High School opened its doors in the 2009\u20132010 school year to its first classes of freshmen and sophomores.[41]Calvary Chapel Bible College, built upon the old Murrieta Hot Springs resort, and its affiliated private comprehensive (K-12) school Calvary Chapel Murrieta also serve the Murrieta community. The Menifee campus of Mt. San Jacinto College is the nearest community college and the University of California, Riverside (UCR) is the nearest public university. The city is also the location of a University of Phoenix learning center, as well as an Azusa Pacific University satellite campus.[42][43]Laurel Cemetery (also known as Murrieta Cemetery) is located near the southwest city limits.[44] Notable interments at the cemetery include actor Douglas Fowley.[45]The Town Square is home to the Murrieta Police Department, Murrieta Public Library, City Hall, and a senior center. The Town Square is also home to a new memorial for military veterans. At a cost of $2 million, with the city providing $500,000 in start-up fees, the memorial features an honor garden, memorial obelisk, and a World War II memorial wall.[46]Murrieta has three golf courses within the city limits. Bear Creek Golf & Country Club is located within the gated residential community of Bear Creek. It is a private 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus at which Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford have played. The California Oaks Golf Course is located within The Colony, a gated senior residential community and is a public 18-hole course. The Golf Club at Rancho California is an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., and is located on the east side of the city.[47]The area of southwest Riverside County is served by station Channel 27.[48]Murrieta has several youth sports programs, affording area children extra-curricular sports options such as football (flag, AAU/USA Football, AYF, Jr. All-American, and Pop Warner), basketball, baseball, soccer, softball, street hockey, and cheerleading.[49] Southern California Golf Schools offer the Southern California Junior Golfers Players' Club.Murrieta has a Mulligan Family Fun Center, with miniature golf, go-kart racing, laser tag, and an arcade. A movie theater and additional go-kart track, Pole Position, are additional entertainment options. As of 2012, Murrieta opened a comedy club, Aces, and a trampoline park. In late 2013, a roller rink, EPIC Rollertainment, was opened. Annually, both Murrieta and neighboring Temecula share the Rod Run, a classic car event where classic car owners and enthusiasts can showcase and enjoy hundreds of classic cars. Murrieta also features several sports parks.Outside of the city limits are the Santa Rosa Plateau, the Temecula Valley Wine Country, and Lake Skinner. The Santa Rosa Plateau, an ecological reserve which is jointly owned by the county and state governments, a private conservation group, and the local water district, is just outside the city to the west.[50] Visitors can observe endangered wildlife, both flora and fauna (including the threatened Engelmann oak). The Temecula Valley Wine Country is approximately 7.5 miles southeast of Murrieta and includes over 40 wineries, several of which include restaurants and lodging amenities. Lake Skinner offers sailing, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, hiking, and developed campsites.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pop_music": "Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.[4] The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.David Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as \"a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music\".[8]\nAccording to Pete Seeger, pop music is \"professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music\".[3]\nDavid Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music as any type of music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media.[9] Most individuals think that pop music is just the singles charts and not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. As a genre, pop music is seen to exist and develop separately.[10] Therefore, the term \"pop music\" may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as \"instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers\" in contrast to rock music as \"album-based music for adults\".[4][12]Pop music continuously evolves along with the term's definition. According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as \"the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.\"[13] The term \"pop song\" was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music \"having popular appeal\".[14] Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues, and hillbilly music.[15]According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the term \"pop music\" \"originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced\".[2] The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's \"earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc.\"[16] Grove Music Online also states that \"[...] in the early 1960s, [the term] 'pop music' competed terminologically with beat music [in England], while in the US its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and roll'\".[2]From about 1967, the term \"pop music\" was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms.[17] While rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music,[17] pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.[18] According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced \"as a matter of enterprise not art\", and is \"designed to appeal to everyone\" but \"doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste\". Frith adds that it is \"not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative\". It is, \"provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below\u00a0... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged\".[4]According to Frith, characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology, and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal \"artistic\" qualities.[4] Besides, Frith also offers three identifying characteristics of pop music: light entertainment, commercial imperatives, and personal identification. Pop music grew out of a light entertainment/ easy listening tradition.[21] Pop music is more conservative than other music genres such as folk, blues, country, and tradition. Many pop songs do not contain themes of resistance, opposition, or political themes, rather focusing more on love and relationships.  Therefore, pop music does not challenge its audiences socially, and does not cause political activism. Frith also said the main purpose of pop music is to create revenue. It is not a medium of free articulation of the people. Instead, pop music seeks to supply the nature of personal desire and achieve the instant empathy with cliche personalities, stereotypes, and melodrama that appeals to listeners. It is mostly about how much revenue pop music makes for record companies.[22] Music scholar Timothy Warner said pop music typically has an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, rather than live performance; a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments; and seeks to encourage dancing or uses dance-oriented rhythms.[18]The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and a simple traditional structure.[23] The structure of many popular songs is that of a verse and a chorus, the chorus serving as the portion of the track that is designed to stick in the ear through simple repetition both musically and lyrically. The chorus is often where the music builds towards and is often preceded by \"the drop\" where the bass and drum parts \"drop out\".[24] Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks, and a chorus that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and harmonically with the verse.[25] The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment.[26] The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes\u00a0\u2013 often love and romantic relationships\u00a0\u2013 although there are notable exceptions.[4]Harmony and chord progressions in pop music are often \"that of classical European tonality, only more simple-minded.\"[27] Clich\u00e9s include the barbershop quartet-style harmony (i.e. ii \u2013 V \u2013 I) and blues scale-influenced harmony.[28] There was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the circle of fifths between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, including less predominance for the dominant function.[29]In the 1940s, improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style and, ten or twenty years later, inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles \"revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated\", which helped to move pop music to \"a record/radio/film star system\".[31] Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances, forcing \"pop stars had to have a visual presence\".[31] In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable transistor radios meant that teenagers in the developed world could listen to music outside of the home.[31] By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which \"favoured those artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal\".[31]Multi-track recording (from the 1960s) and digital sampling (from the 1980s) have also been utilized as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music.[4] During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word \"progressive\" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a \"progression\" from the last.[32] Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between \"progressive\" pop and \"mass/chart\" pop, a separation which was \"also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\"[33]The latter half of the 20th-century included a large-scale trend in American culture in which the boundaries between art and pop music were increasingly blurred.[34] Between 1950 and 1970, there was a debate of pop versus art.[35] Since then, certain music publications have embraced the music's legitimacy, a trend referred to as \"poptimism\".[35]Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on the sentimental ballad for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from gospel and soul music, instrumentation from jazz and rock music, orchestration from classical music, tempo from dance music, backing from electronic music, rhythmic elements from hip-hop music, and spoken passages from rap.[4][verification needed] In 2016, a Scientific Reports study that examined over 464,000 recordings of popular music recorded between 1955 and 2010 found that, compared to 1960s pop music, contemporary pop music uses a smaller variety of pitch progressions, greater average volume,[36] less diverse instrumentation and recording techniques, and less timbral variety.[37] Scientific American's John Matson reported that this \"seems to support the popular anecdotal observation that pop music of yore was \"better\", or at least more varied, than today's top-40 stuff\". However, he also noted that the study may not have been entirely representative of pop in each generation.[37]In the 1960s,  the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra.[38] Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados.[39] At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined Tin Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched rock guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians.[40]  A 2019 study held by New York University in which 643 participants had to rank how familiar a pop song is to them, songs from the 1960s turned out to be the most memorable, significantly more than songs from recent years 2000 to 2015.[41]Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music.[42] Assisted by the mid-1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them the freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing.[43] This situation declined after the late 1970s and would not reemerge until the rise of Internet stars.[43] Indie pop, which developed in the late 1970s, marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, with guitar bands formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label.[44]The 1980s are commonly remembered for an increase in the use of digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synth-pop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity.[45] By 2014, pop music worldwide had been permeated by electronic dance music.[46] In 2018, researchers at the University of California, Irvine, concluded that pop music has become 'sadder' since the 1980s. The elements of happiness and brightness have eventually been replaced with electronic beats making pop music more 'sad yet danceable'.[47]The story of pop music is largely the story of the intertwining pop culture of the United States and the United Kingdom in the postwar era.\u2014 Bob Stanley[46]Pop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British music industries, whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture, but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics.[48] Some of these trends (for example Europop) have had a significant impact on the development of the genre.[49]According to Grove Music Online, \"Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures\".[50] Some non-Western countries, such as Japan, have developed a thriving pop music industry, most of which is devoted to Western-style pop. Japan has for several years produced a greater quantity of music than everywhere except the US.[clarification needed][50] The spread of Western-style pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of Americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative appropriation, cultural imperialism, or a more general process of globalization.[50]One of the pop music styles that developed alongside other music styles is Latin pop, which rose in popularity in the US during the 1950s with early rock and roll success Ritchie Valens.[51] Later, as Los Lobos garnered major Chicano rock popularity during the 1970s and 1980s, musician Selena saw large-scale pop music presence as the 1980s and 1990s progressed, along with crossover appeal with fans of Tejano music pioneers Lydia Mendoza and Little Joe.[52] With later Hispanic and Latino Americans seeing success within pop music charts, 1990s pop successes stayed popular in both their original genres and in broader pop music.[53] Latin pop hit singles, such as \"Macarena\" by Los del R\u00edo and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi, have seen record-breaking success on worldwide pop music charts.[54]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pop_rock": "Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock[4]) is a rock music genre with a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude.[5][1] Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo-wop).[1]  It may be viewed as a distinct genre field rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock.[4]  The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less authentic than rock music.[6]Much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms \"pop rock\" and \"power pop\" have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music.[7]  Writer Johan Fornas views pop/rock as \"one single, continuous genre field\", rather than distinct categories.[4] To the authors Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman, it is defined as an \"upbeat variety of rock music\" represented by artists and bands such as: Andy Kim, the Bells, Paul McCartney, Lighthouse, and Peter Frampton.[8]The term pop has been used since the early twentieth century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.[9][1] In the aftermath of the British Invasion, from about 1967, it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.[10]As of the 2010s, \"guitar pop rock\" and \"indie rock\" are roughly synonymous terms.[11] \"Jangle\" is a noun-adjective that music critics often use in reference to guitar pop with a bright mood.[12]Critic Philip Auslander argues that the distinction between pop and rock is more pronounced in the US than in the UK. He claims that in the US, pop has roots in white crooners such as Perry Como, whereas rock is rooted in African-American music influenced by forms such as rock and roll. Auslander points out that the concept of pop rock, which blends pop and rock, is at odds with the typical conception of pop and rock as opposites. Auslander and several other scholars, such as Simon Frith and Grossberg, argue that pop music is often depicted as an inauthentic, cynical, \"slickly commercial\", and formulaic form of entertainment. In contrast, rock music is often heralded as an authentic, sincere, and anti-commercial form of music, which emphasizes songwriting by the singers and bands, instrumental virtuosity, and a \"real connection with the audience\".[13]Simon Frith's analysis of the history of popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s has been criticized by B. J. Moore-Gilbert, who argues that Frith and other scholars have over-emphasized the role of rock in the history of popular music by naming every new genre using the \"rock\" suffix. Thus when a folk-oriented style of music developed in the 1960s, Frith termed it \"folk rock\", and the pop-infused styles of the 1970s were called \"pop rock\". Moore-Gilbert claims that this approach unfairly puts rock at the apex and makes every other influence become an add-on to the central core of rock.[14]In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau discussed the term \"pop-rock\" in the context of popular music's fragmentation along stylistic lines in the 1970s; he regarded \"pop-rock\" as a \"monolith\" that \"straddled\" all burgeoning movements and subgenres in the popular and semipopular music marketplace at the time, including singer-songwriter music, art rock, heavy metal, boogie, country rock, jazz fusion, funk, disco, urban contemporary, and new wave, but not punk rock.[15]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Indie_pop": "Indie pop (also typeset as indie-pop or indiepop) is a music genre and subculture[1] that combines guitar pop with DIY ethic[3] in opposition to the style and tone of mainstream pop music.[8] It originated from British post-punk[4] in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Compared to its counterpart, indie rock,[7] the genre is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free.[7] In later years, the definition of indie pop has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings.[4] Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop.[7]Indie pop is not just \"indie\" that is \"pop.\" Not too many people realize this, or really care either way. But you can be sure indie pop's fans know it. They have their own names for themselves ... the music they listen to ... their own canon of legendary bands ... and legendary labels ... their own pop stars ... their own zines ... websites ... mailing lists ... aesthetics ... festivals ... iconography ... fashion accessories ... and in-jokes ... in short, their own culture.\u2014Nitsuh Abebe, Pitchfork[1]Within indie genres, issues of authenticity are especially prominent: indie was born in a Utopian attempt to stop the inevitable cycle of bands being co-opted - and, it is assumed, corrupted - by the mainstream.\u2014Emily I. Dolan, Popular Music[2]Both indie and indie pop had originally referred to the same thing during the late 1970s. Inspired more by punk rock's DIY ethos than its style, guitar bands were formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music instead of having to procure a record contract from a major label.[1] According to Emily Dolan, indie is predicated on the distorted music of the Velvet Underground, the \"rebellious screaming\" of early punk, and \"some of rock's more quirky and eccentric figures\", such as Jonathan Richman.[2] Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe identifies the majority of indie as \"all about that 60s-styled guitar jangle\".[1]Indie pop was an unprecedented contrast from the gritty and serious tones of previous underground rock styles, as well as being a departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music.[1] Distinguished from the angst and abrasiveness of its indie rock counterpart,[7] the majority of indie pop borrows not only the stripped-down quality of punk, but also \"the sweetness and catchiness of mainstream pop\".[2] Music critic Simon Reynolds says that indie pop defines itself against \"charting pop\".[8] Abebe explains:One of those things was the idea that rock music was supposed to be cool \u2013 \"cool\" meaning sexy, tough, arty, fiery, or fantastical... The charts had \"cool\" covered \u2013 these kids, in their basements and bedrooms, were trying to hand-craft a mirror-image of it, a pop world where they were the stars... and a little bit of a raspberry blown at the larger musical world, which (sensibly) went right on preferring something more interesting than average white kids playing simple pop songs.[1]Despite their relatively minor commercial success (their third album was sardonically titled They Could Have Been Bigger than the Beatles), the Television Personalities are highly regarded by critics and have been widely influential, especially on the C86 generation.[9] Simon Reynolds has said that \"what we now know as indie music was invented in Scotland,\"[10] with reference to the emergence of Postcard Records in 1979. However, some have posited that concept of indie music did not crystallise until the late 1980s and early 1990s.[2] Brisbane band \"the Go-Betweens\" were an early influential indie pop band, releasing their first single \"Lee Remick\" in 1978.[11] American indie pop band Beat Happening's 1985 eponymous debut album was also influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America.[12] In the early 1990s, English indie pop influenced and branched off to a variety of styles. The US, which did not have as much of a scene in the 1980s, had many indie pop enthusiasts by the mid 1990s.[1] Most of the modern notion of indie music stems from NME's 1986 compilation C86, which collects many guitar bands who were inspired by the early psychedelic sounds of 1960s garage rock.[13]Names that indie pop fans use for themselves are popkids and popgeeks, and for the music they listen to, p!o!p, twee, anorak and C86. Abebe says that the Scottish group the Pastels typified the \"hip end of 'anorak': Their lazy melodies, lackadaisical strum, and naive attitude transformed the idea of the rock band into something casual, intimate, and free from the pretense of cool\".[1]Everett True, a writer for NME in the 1980s, believes that C86 was not the main factor behind indie pop, arguing that Sarah Records was more responsible for sticking to a particular sound, and that: \"C86 didn't actually exist as a sound, or style. ... I find it weird, bordering on surreal, that people are starting to use it as a description again\".[14] Geoff Taylor, a member of the band Age of Chance, added: \"We never considered ourselves part of any scene. I\u2019m not sure that the public at large did either, to be honest. We were just an independent band around at that same time as the others.\"[15][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]Bob Stanley, a Melody Maker journalist in the late 1980s and founding member of pop band Saint Etienne, acknowledges that participants at the time reacted against lazy labelling, but insists they shared an approach:[improper synthesis?] \"Of course the 'scene', like any scene, barely existed. Like squabbling Marxist factions, groups who had much in common built up petty rivalries. The June Brides and the Jasmine Minks were the biggest names at Alan McGee's Living Room Club and couldn't stand the sight of each other. Only when the Jesus and Mary Chain exploded and stole their two-headed crown did they realise they were basically soulmates.[16][verification needed] Manic Street Preachers bassist Nicky Wire remembers that it was the bands' very independence that gave the scene coherence: \"People were doing everything themselves - making their own records, doing the artwork, gluing the sleeves together, releasing them and sending them out, writing fanzines because the music press lost interest really quickly.\"[17]Many of the actual C86 bands distanced themselves from the scene cultivated around them by the UK music press - in its time, C86 became a pejorative term for its associations with so-called \"shambling\" (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement.[18][verification needed]Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop[7] that originates from C86. Characterised by its simplicity and perceived innocence, some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, most bands were distributed by Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US).[19]Shibuya-kei is a Japanese style from the 1990s that was embraced by indie pop enthusiasts, partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Out of all the Japanese groups from the scene, Pizzicato Five was the closest in achieving mainstream success in the US.[20]Chamber pop is a subgenre of indie pop that features lush orchestrations. Heavily influenced by Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach,[7] the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for \u00e9l Records embodied the sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that typified the style,[21] whilst the Divine Comedy were the most popular chamber pop act of the Britpop era.[22]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Alternative_pop": "Alternative rock (also known as alternative music, alt-rock, or simply alternative) is a category of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. \"Alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late 1970s punk rock.[5]Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegazing. In September 1988, Billboard introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.[6][7]Initially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction, were signed to major labels. But most alternative bands remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.Due to success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes in the early 2000s, an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from post-punk and new wave found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s, establishing the post-punk revival movement.In the past, popular music tastes were dictated by music executives within large entertainment corporations. Record companies signed contracts with those entertainers who were thought to become the most popular, and therefore who could generate the most sales. These bands were able to record their songs in expensive studios, and their works then offered for sale through record store chains that were owned by the entertainment corporations, along with eventually selling the merchandise into big box retailers. Record companies worked with radio and television companies to get the most exposure for their artists. The people making the decisions were business people dealing with music as a product, and those bands who were not making the expected sales figures were then excluded from this system.[8]Before the term alternative rock came into common usage around 1990, the sorts of music to which it refers were known by a variety of terms.[9] In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term Alternative Music to describe the groups he was writing about.[10] In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled \"Rock and Roll Alternative\".[11]  \"College rock\" was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college radio circuit and the tastes of college students.[12] In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged as a result of the punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, NME and Sounds magazines published charts based on small record stores called \"Alternative Charts\". The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term indie was used literally to describe independently distributed records.[13] By 1985, indie had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.[12]The use of the term alternative to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s;[14] at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were new music and post modern, respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to recontextualize sounds of the past.[5][15] A similar term, alternative pop, emerged around 1985.[16]In 1987, Spin magazine categorized college rock band Camper Van Beethoven as \"alternative/indie\", noting that their 1985 song \"Where the Hell Is Bill\" (from Telephone Free Landslide Victory) \"called out the alternative/independent scene and dryly tore it apart.\"[17] David Lowery, then frontman of Camper Van Beethoven, later recalled: \"I remember first seeing that word applied to us... The nearest I could figure is that we seemed like a punk band, but we were playing pop music, so they made up this word alternative for those of us who do that.\"[18] DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American FM radio of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to top 40 radio formats by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, \"Somehow this term 'alternative' got rediscovered and heisted by college radio people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music.\"[19]At first the term referred to intentionally non-mainstream rock acts that were not influenced by \"heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave\" and \"high-energy dance anthems\".[20] Usage of the term would broaden to include new wave, pop, punk rock, post-punk, and occasionally \"college\"/\"indie\" rock, all found on the American \"commercial alternative\" radio stations of the time such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM. Journalist Jim Gerr wrote that Alternative also encompassed variants such as \"rap, trash, metal and industrial\".[21] The bill of the first Lollapalooza, an itinerant festival in North America conceived by Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, reunited \"disparate elements of the alternative rock community\" including Henry Rollins, Butthole Surfers, Ice-T, Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees (as second headliners) and Jane's Addiction (as the headlining act).[21] Covering for MTV the opening date of Lollapalooza in Phoenix in July 1991, Dave Kendall introduced the report saying the festival presented the \"most diverse lineups of alternative rock\".[22] That summer, Farrell had coined the term Alternative Nation.[23]In December 1991, Spin magazine noted: \"this year, for the first time, it became resoundingly clear that what has formerly been considered alternative rock\u2014a college-centered marketing group with fairly lucrative, if limited, potential\u2014has in fact moved into the mainstream.\"[21]In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific.[5] In 1997, Neil Strauss of The New York Times defined alternative rock as \"hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, '70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions.\"[20]Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. Alternative can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is \"fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream\", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote \"the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet.\"[24] However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term \"alternative\" to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach.[25] Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book Alternative Rock cites the formation of the Sex Pistols as well as the release of the albums Horses by Patti Smith and Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock.[26] Until the early 2000s, when indie rock became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms \"indie rock\" and \"alternative rock\" were often used interchangeably;[27] whilst there are aspects which both genres have in common, \"indie rock\" was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American \"alternative rock\".[28]The name \"alternative rock\" essentially serves as an umbrella term for underground music that has emerged in the wake of punk rock since the mid-1980s.[29] Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the commercialism of mainstream culture, although this could be contested ever since some of the major alternative artists have achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onward (especially since the new millennium and beyond). Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth.[30] As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although The New York Times in 1989 asserted that the genre is \"guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback.\"[31] More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism.[30] This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.[32]A precursor to alternative rock existed in the 1960s with the proto-punk scene.[33] The origins of alternative rock can be traced back to The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) by the Velvet Underground,[34] which influenced many alternative rock bands that would come after it.[35] Eccentric and quirky figures of the 1960s, such as Syd Barrett have influence on alternative rock in general.[36]The Dead Kennedys formed the independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 1979, releasing influential underground music such as the 1983 self-titled EP from the Butthole Surfers. By 1984, a majority of groups signed to indie labels mined from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.[37]\"Alternative music is music that hasn't yet achieved a mainstream audience, Alternative isn't new wave any more, it's a disposition of mind. Alternative music is any kind of music that has the potential to reach a wider audience. It also has real strength, real quality, real excitement, and it has to be socially significant, as opposed to Whitney Houston, which is pablum.\"\u2014Mark Josephson, Executive Director of the New Music Seminar speaking in 1988[38]Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.[29] College radio formed an essential part of breaking new alternative music. In the mid-1980s, college station KCPR in San Luis Obispo, California, described in a DJ handbook the tension between popular and \"cutting edge\" songs as played on \"alternative radio\".[39]Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.[40] On September 10, 1988, an Alternative Songs chart was created by Billboard, listing the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations in the US: the first number one was Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Peek-a-Boo\".[41] By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and the Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.[42]In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US.[43] Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.[44]Early American alternative bands such as the Dream Syndicate, the Bongos, 10,000 Maniacs, R.E.M., the Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; their debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers.[45] One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as the Velvet Underground.[29]American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.[46] Minneapolis bands H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.[29] Michael Azerrad asserted that H\u00fcsker D\u00fc was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, \"H\u00fcsker D\u00fc played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical.\"[47] The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as \"a viable commercial enterprise\".[48] By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, the Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that \"along with R.E.M., they were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked.\"[49]By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard[50]) and industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston's Pixies and Los Angeles' Jane's Addiction.[29] Around the same time, the grunge subgenre emerged in Seattle, Washington, initially referred to as \"The Seattle Sound\" until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s.[51] Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that syncretized heavy metal and punk rock.[52] Promoted largely by Seattle indie label Sub Pop, grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather.[53] Early grunge bands Soundgarden and Mudhoney found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively.[29]By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough.[54][55] Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.[29]In the middle of the decade, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's album Zen Arcade influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.'s hardcore scene what was called \"emocore\" or, later, \"emo\" emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional, very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. Rites of Spring has been described as the first \"emo\" band. Former Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye founded Dischord Records which became the center for the city's emo scene.[56]Gothic rock developed out of late-1970s British post-punk. With a reputation as the \"darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock\", gothic rock utilizes a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct \"foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes\", and the subgenre's lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism.[57] Bands of this subgenre took inspiration from two British post-punk groups, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees.[58] Bauhaus' debut single \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock subgenre.[59] The Cure's \"oppressively dispirited\" albums including Pornography (1982) cemented that group's stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.[60]The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was Manchester's the Smiths. Music journalist Simon Reynolds singled out the Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as \"the two most important alt-rock bands of the day\", commenting that they \"were eighties bands only in the sense of being against the eighties\".[61] The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer Morrissey's English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist Johnny Marr's jangly guitar-playing style.[43] The C86 cassette, a 1986 NME premium featuring Primal Scream, the Wedding Present and others, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole.[62][63]Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. the Jesus and Mary Chain's sound combined the Velvet Underground's \"melancholy noise\" with Beach Boys pop melodies and Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" production,[64][65] while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with disco and dance music.[43] The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., C86 and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the formative influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar effects pedals[66] onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive created an overwhelmingly loud \"wash of sound\" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback.[67] Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the Madchester scene. Performing for the most part in the Ha\u00e7ienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.[68]By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels had already signed Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dinosaur Jr.[54] In early 1991, R.E.M. went mainstream worldwide with Out of Time while becoming a blueprint for many alternative bands.[29]The first edition of the Lollapalooza festival became the most successful tour in North America in July and August 1991. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who caught it near Los Angeles in an open-air amphitheater, \"it felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all\". The tour helped change the mentalities in the music industry: \"by that fall, radio and MTV and music had changed. I really think that if it weren\u2019t for Perry [Farrell], if it weren\u2019t for Lollapalooza, you and I wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation right now\".[69]The release of the Nirvana's single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in September 1991 \"marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon\". Helped by constant airplay of the song's music video on MTV, their album Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991.[70] Its success surprised the music industry. Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established \"the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.\"[71] Michael Azerrad asserted that Nevermind symbolized \"a sea-change in rock music\" in which the hair metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant.[72] The breakthrough success of Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s. It heralded a \"new openness to alternative rock\" among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular.[73] In the wake of Nevermind, alternative rock \"found itself dragged-kicking and screaming\u00a0... into the mainstream\" and record companies, confused by the genre's success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands.[74] The New York Times declared in 1993, \"Alternative rock doesn't seem so alternative anymore. Every major label has a handful of guitar-driven bands in shapeless shirts and threadbare jeans, bands with bad posture and good riffs who cultivate the oblique and the evasive, who conceal catchy tunes with noise and hide craftsmanship behind nonchalance.\"[75] However, many alternative rock artists rejected success, for it conflicted with the rebellious, DIY ethic the genre had espoused before mainstream exposure and their ideas of artistic authenticity.[76]Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. Pearl Jam had released its debut album Ten a month before Nevermind in 1991, but album sales only picked up a year later.[77] By the second half of 1992 Ten became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard 200 album chart.[78] Soundgarden's album Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core along with the Temple of the Dog album collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992.[79] The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle \"the new Liverpool\".[53] Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success.[80]At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. Entertainment Weekly commented in a 1993 article, \"There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s.\"[81] The New York Times compared the \"grunging of America\" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years. As a result of the genre's popularity, a backlash against grunge developed in Seattle.[53] Nirvana's follow-up album In Utero (1993) was an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a \"wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record.\"[82] Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993 In Utero topped the Billboard charts.[83] Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, Vs. (1993), which topped the Billboard charts by selling a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release.[84]With the decline of the Madchester scene and the unglamorousness of shoegazing, the tide of grunge from America dominated the British alternative scene and music press in the early 1990s.[43] As a reaction, a flurry of British bands emerged that wished to \"get rid of grunge\" and \"declare war on America\", taking the public and native music press by storm.[85] Dubbed \"Britpop\" by the media, this movement represented by Pulp, Blur, Suede, and Oasis was the British equivalent of the grunge explosion, in that the artists propelled alternative rock to the top of the charts in their home country.[43] Britpop bands were influenced by and displayed reverence for British guitar music of the past, particularly movements and genres such as the British Invasion, glam rock, and punk rock.[86] In 1995 the Britpop phenomenon culminated in a rivalry between its two chief groups, Oasis and Blur, symbolized by their release of competing singles on the same day. Blur won \"The Battle of Britpop\", but Oasis soon eclipsed the other band in popularity with their second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995),[87] which went on to become the third best-selling album in the UK's history.[88]Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the US, indie rock became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana.[89] Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of alternative rock's absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its \"macho\" aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as \"the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place\".[89]Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like Pavement, Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney dominated the American indie scene for most of the 1990s.[90] One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was lo-fi. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality cassette tapes, initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences.[91] The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, PJ Harvey fit into this sub group.[92]During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely \"a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock.\"; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, \"but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists.\"[93] Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.[93] Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an \"authentic\" rock movement.[94] Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of About.com, is \"suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music.\"[94] Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters, Creed and Nickelback emerged.[94]Post-rock was established by Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland albums, both released in 1991.[95] Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including Krautrock, progressive rock, and jazz. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music.[95] While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994 referring to Hex by the London group Bark Psychosis,[96] the style of the genre was solidified by the release of Millions Now Living Will Never Die (1996) by the Chicago group Tortoise.[95] Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure.[95] A related genre, math rock, peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock relies on more complex time signatures and intertwining phrases.[97] By the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its \"dispassionate intellectuality\" and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R\u00f3s emerged who further expanded the genre.[95]In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream was a major commercial success. The strong influence of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio.[98]\nIn 1995, Smashing Pumpkins also released their double album Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness which went on to sell 10\u00a0million copies in the US alone, certifying it as a Diamond record.After almost a decade in the underground, ska punk, a mixture of earlier British ska and punk acts, became popular in the United States. Rancid was the first of the \"Third Wave Ska Revival\" acts to break. In 1996, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt, Sublime, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and Save Ferris charted or received radio exposure.[99][100]The Amerindie of the early '80s became known as alternative or alt-rock, ascendant from Nirvana until 1996 or so but currently very unfashionable, never mind that the music is still there.\u2014 Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s (2000)[101]By the end of the decade, alternative rock's style changed due to a number of events, notably the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter Ticketmaster, which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States.[76] In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, Be Here Now (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock.[102] A signifier of alternative rock's changes was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, \"Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now\".[103]Despite a change in style, alternative rock still managed to be mainstream. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States.[93] At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.[104]In the mid-1990s, Sunny Day Real Estate defined the emo genre. Weezer's album Pinkerton (1996) was also influential. By 2000 and on into the new decade, emo was one of the most popular rock music genres.[56] Popular acts included the sales success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most (2003).[105] The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations.[105] At the same time, use of the term \"emo\" expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion.[106] Emo's mainstream success continued with bands emerging in the 2000s, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy[107] and My Chemical Romance[108] and mainstream groups such as Paramore[107] and Panic! at the Disco.[109]During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol and the Rapture that drew primary inspiration from post-punk and new wave, establishing the post-punk revival movement.[110] Preceded by the success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes earlier in the decade, an influx of new alternative rock bands, including several post-punk revival artists and others such as the Killers, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s. Owing to the success of these bands, Entertainment Weekly declared in 2004, \"After almost a decade of domination by rap-rock and nu-metal bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again.\"[111] Thirty Seconds to Mars experienced a notable rise in popularity during the latter half of the 2000s.[112] American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album Californication (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s. Arctic Monkeys were a prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking,[113] with two UK No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.[114]Most references to alternative rock music in the United States past 2010 are to the indie rock genre, a term that previously had limited usage on alternative rock channels and media.[27] Radio stations in the 2010s have been changing formats away from alternative rock, but this is mostly motivated by conglomeration efforts coupled with advertisers seeking more Top 40/Top 100 stations for sales.[115]  While there have been conflicting opinions on the relevance of alternative rock to mainstream audiences beyond 2010,[116][117] Dave Grohl commented on an article from the December 29, 2013 issue of the New York Daily News stating that rock is dead:[118] \"speak for yourself... rock seems pretty alive to me.\"[119]Contemporary mainstream alternative rock bands tend to fuse musical elements of hard rock, electronica, hip-hop, indie and punk while placing emphasis on keyboards and guitar. In 2010s, British rock band Muse gained a worldwide recognition with their album The Resistance and Drones which won Grammy Awards.[120][121] American alternative duo Twenty One Pilots blurs the lines between genres including hip hop, emo, rock, indie pop and reggae and has managed to break numerous records.[122] They became the first alternative act to have two concurrent top five singles in the United States while their fourth studio album Blurryface (2015) was the first album in history to have every song receive at least a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[123][124][125] Twenty One Pilots also became the first rock act to have a song reach a billion streams on Spotify.[126] Their breakout hit single \"Stressed Out\" was the twenty-fifth song to achieve the rare feat of at least one billion plays on the streaming platform. The milestone comes at a time when music genres represented on streaming platforms like Spotify are fairly homogeneous, being dominated by genres such as hip hop, EDM, and adult contemporary-styled pop.[126]Alternative pop is a term that originated in the mid-1980s to describe underground pop music that experimented with an eclectic range of influences and musically challenging arrangements.[127] According to AllMusic's entry for \"alternative pop/rock\", the \u201cleft-of-center pop\u201d of the genre failed to experience mainstream success during the 1980s.[128]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sour_(album)": "Sour (stylized in all caps) is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter and actress Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on May 21, 2021, via Geffen Records. The album was written by Rodrigo and her producer Dan Nigro. Originally planned as an EP, Rodrigo expanded Sour into a full-length album following the viral success of her debut single, \"Drivers License\".Influenced by Rodrigo's favorite genres and singer-songwriters, Sour is primarily a pop record that spans from energetic pop punk songs to bedroom pop ballads. Its subject matter centers on adolescence, failed romance, and heartache. She said the album explores her perils and discoveries as a 17-year-old, with its title referring to the \"sour\" emotions young people experience but are often criticized for, such as anger, jealousy, and unhappiness.Three singles preceded Sour's release, all of which entered the top three of the US Billboard Hot 100. The lead single, \"Drivers License\", topped the chart and propelled Rodrigo to mainstream prominence. It was followed by \"Deja Vu\", which peaked at number 3, and \"Good 4 U\", the album's second chart-topper. It made Rodrigo the first artist in history to debut their first three singles in the top 10 of the Hot 100, and Sour the first debut album in history to spawn two number-one debuts on the chart. The album broke the global Spotify record for the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist. It topped the charts in several countries, including the US Billboard 200. \"Traitor\", prior to becoming the fourth single, landed at number nine on the Hot 100 as the fourth top-10 song from the album. Sour was one of the best-selling albums of 2021.Sour received widespread acclaim upon release, with it being regarded as a solid debut album, underscoring Rodrigo's realistic lyrics and appeal to Generation Z. Various publications listed it among the best albums of 2021, including Billboard and Rolling Stone that placed the album at number one on their year-end rankings. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Sour and \"Drivers License\" won Best Pop Vocal Album and Pop Solo Performance, respectively; Rodrigo won Best New Artist as well. A YouTube concert film and a Disney+ documentary, titled Sour Prom and Driving Home 2 U respectively, supplement the album. Rodrigo embarked on the Sour Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on April 5, 2022.In 2020, American actress and singer Olivia Rodrigo signed to Geffen Records, intending to release her debut EP the following year.[4] American songwriter and producer Daniel Nigro was suggested by a friend to listen to Rodrigo's songs on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Soundtrack (2020). Nigro was \"just completely blown away\" and reached out to Rodrigo via Instagram, offering to work with her. The pair had a meeting to get to know one another, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the United States. They started collaborating after figuring out ways to work safely in isolation.[5][6] She released her debut single \"Drivers License\", produced by Nigro, on January 8, 2021, to unprecedented commercial and critical success. Billboard declared the single one of the most dominant number-one songs in Hot 100 history.[7]Rodrigo began teasing a follow-up single by archiving her past Instagram posts and posting cryptic teasers of it on her social media accounts in late March 2021;[8] on March 29, she announced that it would be titled \"Deja Vu\", and set a release date of three days later, reassuring fans that the announcement was not an April Fools' Day joke. Rodrigo unveiled the song's artwork in the same post.[9][10] Following her rise to prominence, Rodrigo stated that she would be releasing a studio album instead of an EP,[11] after she felt unsatisfied with the scope of a shorter project when only a full-length album would be \"truly reflective of what [she] can do\".[12]I want [Sour] to be super versatile. My dream is to have it be an intersection between mainstream pop, folk music, and alternative pop. I love the songwriting and the lyricism and the melodies of folk music. I love the tonality of alt-pop. Obviously, I'm obsessed with pop and pop artists. So I'm going to try and take all of my sort of influences ... and make something that I like.Rodrigo described her ambition for her debut project, Sour, was a \"super versatile\" body of work that mainly blends mainstream pop, folk, and alternative rock genres,[1] alongside elements of pop-punk, country and grunge.[13] She stated that it is inspired by the works of her favorite singer-songwriters, such as Alanis Morissette, Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves,[14] and the \"pouty\", \"angsty\" sound of rock acts like No Doubt and the White Stripes.[15] Rodrigo also cited her mother Jennifer's musical tastes as an influence, as it was her who introduced young Rodrigo to metal, punk and 1990s alternative rock.[12]Rodrigo's vision for the album's lyrics was to explore a variety of \"sour\" emotions that young women \"are often shamed for\", such as anger, jealousy and sadness. The album title refers to the concept of \"awesome things\" in Rodrigo's life \"progressively going sour\" as she gets older, representing a specific \"slice\" of her life as a 17-year-old, \"its unending growing pains and surprising discoveries.\"[15] She insisted this point in her interview to The Guardian as well, saying Sour is an \"intrinsically young\" album that is aimed at honoring \"acute teenage feelings\". Rodrigo explained, \"something I'm really proud of is that this record talks about emotions that are hard to talk about or aren't really socially acceptable especially for girls: anger, jealousy, spite, sadness, they're frowned-upon as bitchy and moaning and complaining or whatever. But I think they're such valid emotions.\"[16]According to Rodrigo, the word \"sour\" has many different meanings and she tried to write a song titled \"Sour\" for a long time but was unsuccessful in doing so, making her realize that it is an \"all-encompassing\" trope that covered the sour portion of her life.[17] She tried to balance out the \"sour\" songs of the album with some love songs, in order to avoid being pigeonholed as \"the heartbreak girl\"; however, she eventually dropped the idea, to preserve her authenticity as a songwriter. She asserted that love and happiness were not the emotions she felt while making the album.[12] Nevertheless, Rodrigo did not want Sour to be filled with \"sad piano songs\" either, hence she infused danceability and upbeat arrangements into the record, evident in tracks such as \"Brutal\" and \"Good 4 U\".[18]Sour has been described as a genre-hopping pop,[19] pop-punk,[20] alternative pop,[21][22] and bedroom pop[23] record with synth-pop, dream pop, alternative rock, pop rock, and folk-pop elements.[24][25][26]  Stylistically, the album spans from energetic 1990s-inspired guitar rock to tender acoustic balladry driven by piano and fingerpicked guitars.[27][28] Craig Jenkins of Vulture categorized Sour as a \"post-genre\" record, one which materializes Rodrigo's aim to transcend boundaries of music genres and coalesce them.[26]The songs of Sour represent different perspectives to a single storyline of failed romance. The songwriting is characterized by self-aware[27] themes of insecurities, anger, revenge, envy, and jealousy, using detail-specific lyrics exuding vulnerability.[29][30][28]Sour opens with \"Brutal\", which was described as \"angsty\" and \"uptempo\" by Rodrigo. The song was characterized as an enjoyable, \"angrily insecure alt-rock tirade\" and \"playful and easy pop-punk\" that \"free falls into the depths of grungy rock\", with elements of indie rock.[31][32][33][34] \"Brutal\" was the last song written for the album; Rodrigo and Nigro wrote the track two weeks before she had to turn in the record. Rodrigo noted that the song represents her teenage years.[35] The song has \"thrashy\" guitars, and was reported to be a \"desire to defy any pop expectations that have been placed upon [Rodrigo] by fans, friends, executives, or exes\".[24] \"Traitor\", the second track, is an indie pop ballad with a folk instrumental.[36][37] Its lyrics have been described to consist of \"post-grief anger and bargaining\".[24] Furthermore, details on the lyrics also depict Rodrigo's ex moving on with another girl while she is unable to get over it as she tries to figure out what went wrong.[33]The fourth track, \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\", interpolates the piano line from Taylor Swift's \"New Year's Day\" (2017),[38] which was a result of Rodrigo singing \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" over the chords of the Swift song.[35] The song is described to be a \"regret-wracked\" tune.[24] Rodrigo revealed that she wrote the hook of the song from a text message, going on to say that she \"thought it would be a cool way to describe this toxic, sort of manipulative relationship\". The chirping birds at the beginning of the track were a result of Nigro recording them through a window at his house.[35] The seventh track, \"Enough For You\", is a \"simple\" and \"minimal\" bedroom pop song with \"searing\" lyrics and acoustic instrumentals.[39][33] Rodrigo described the song as \"very insecure and vulnerable, but [she] also love[s] how it's really hopeful\", referencing the line \"someday I'll be everything to somebody else\".[35] \"Happier\" serves as the eighth track, a piano-led song featuring lyrics admitting selfishness and exuding self-criticism.[33]Being angry, jealous, overly emotional or sad can often be framed as being bitchy or moany. I decided to shine a light on those feelings, even though that was uncomfortable to talk about. I've done all I can do. Everything else is out of my hands.The ninth track, \"Jealousy, Jealousy\", has been described as \"jazzy\",[18] \"serpentine\" and an \"alt-rock squall \u00e0 la\u00a0the Kills\" with a \"plucky bassline and a prowling piano build\".[24][29][33] Lyrics talk about the toxicity of social media and its addictiveness, displaying the obsessions of living a perfect life.[33] The stripped-down tenth track, \"Favorite Crime\", an indie pop and folk-pop song that incorporates a set of layered harmonies with a \"thinly veiled Bonnie and Clyde-type metaphor\".[36][40][24][41][33] It speaks about \"on the examination of glaring red flags that only appear in their true colors through the lens of hindsight\".[33]\"Hope Ur OK\", the closing track, has been reported to be a \"shimmering blessing to down-on-their-luck people Rodrigo has known\", and the sound of the chorus has been described as a benediction.[24] Lyrically, it steps away from Rodrigo's self-referential narratives to secondhand stories from her friends, rooting from her genuine sympathy to them.[33] Rodrigo revealed that the song makes her \"really emotional\", and that the song is \"super personal about people that [she] really love[s]\". On an appearance on The Zach Sang Show, Rodrigo described the placement of the track as the album's closer: \"I feel like it's super hopeful. Sour is a very sort of sad, angry, emotional record, and I wanted to end it with a song that was [reassuring]. It was really important for me to end this sort of somber record on that note.\"[35]On April 1, 2021, Rodrigo announced across her social media accounts that her debut album, with placeholder title *O*R, was scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.[42] Preorders for the album began the following day. On April 13, Rodrigo teased the album's title, and subsequently, revealed the album's title as Sour, posted its track listing and cover artwork on the same day.[43] It was released on May 21, 2021, via retail stores, digital music and streaming platforms, as well as on Rodrigo's website.[44] Vinyl LPs of Sour were released on August 20, 2021, in various colored variants, each of which were exclusively available at Rodrigo's webstore, Urban Outfitters, Target, Walmart, or Amazon.[45]Photographed by Grant Spanier,[46] the standard cover artwork of Sour depicts Rodrigo standing against a purple backdrop, wearing a fuzzy pale pink tank top and checkered bottoms. She sticks her tongue out, with her face covered in a variety of colorful stickers. The stickers on her tongue spell the album title. PopSugar observed that Rodrigo is also wearing a ring in the cover artwork, identical to a ring that Taylor Swift had gifted her earlier. The backside cover also has a purple background, featuring scattered stickers as well as the tracklist on a pearly-colored balloon that Rodrigo's hand is about to pop with a safety pin. In the alternative cover available for the Target-exclusive and vinyl editions of Sour, purple is again the dominant color, but stickers are not present.[47] Stickers also recur through the album artwork and promotional material, which followed a theme of scrapbooking in a school notebook.[48]Sour was supported by five singles, four of which charted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.[49] \"Drivers License\", Rodrigo's debut single, was released on January 8, 2021, as the lead single of Sour.[50] An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Matthew Dillon Cohen, was uploaded to Rodrigo's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release.[51] The song broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song and the biggest first week for a song on Spotify and on Amazon Music.[52] The song debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and made Rodrigo the youngest artist ever to debut atop the chart.[53] It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single also topped charts in the UK,[54] Canada,[55] Australia,[56] and many more countries.\"Deja Vu\" was announced as the second single on her social media accounts on March 29, 2021, and was released three days later along with its music video, directed by Allie Avital in Malibu.[57][58] The song debuted at number eight on the Hot 100, making Rodrigo the first artist in history to debut her first two singles in the top 10 of the chart.[49] It reached a new peak of number three after the release of Sour.[59]The third single, \"Good 4 U\", was announced on May 10, 2021, and was released on May 14.[60] Its music video, directed by Petra Collins, features Rodrigo as a revengeful cheerleader, making references to the 2000s' cult classic films Princess Diaries and Jennifer's Body.[61][62] The energetic song provided listeners the taste of a different side of Sour, departing from the slower and melancholic emotion of the preceding singles \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\".[63] \"Good 4 U\" debuted atop the Hot 100, garnering Rodrigo her second number-one song in the US and the second from Sour.[64]\"Traitor\" impacted US contemporary hit radio formats on August 10, 2021, as the fourth single from Sour.[65] Before it was promoted as a single, \"Traitor\" landed at number 9 on the Hot 100 upon the album release, charting alongside \"Good 4 U\" and \"Deja Vu\" in the top 10 region. Billboard remarked how \"Traitor\" registered impressive sales and streaming tallies for an album track.[66]\"Brutal\" received a music video on August 23, 2021,[67] before it impacted Italian contemporary hit radio formats through Universal Music Italy on September 3, 2021, as the fifth single from the album.[68] Before becoming a single, the song arrived at number 12 on the Hot 100, and landed atop the Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart.Rodrigo gave the debut performance of \"Drivers License\" on February 4, 2021, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[69] She has expressed excitement for a potential upcoming tour in support of the album after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.[70] A sneak-peek of the creation process of the album was featured in IMAX screenings of In the Heights (2021) on Mother's Day.[71]  On May 11, Rodrigo performed \"Drivers License\" at the 2021 Brit Awards held on The O2 Arena in London.[72] On May 12, 2021, a trailer to Sour was posted to Rodrigo's YouTube channel, which showed studio clips of herself and Nigro, and featured a snippet of \"Good 4 U\" which was set to release two days later.[73] She performed \"Drivers License\" and debuted \"Good 4 U\" live at Saturday Night Live on May 15, 2021, hosted by American actor Keegan-Michael Key.[60] On May 16, 2021, a hotline phone number (323-622-SOUR) was made available, which teased an unreleased track from Sour.[74] In the evening of May 20, 2021, Rodrigo appeared on YouTube's livestream of the official premiere party of Sour, as an episode for the platform's Released series. She played voice memos from her phone, discussed songs, interacted with fans, and exclusively performed the track \"Enough for You\".[75] Rodrigo gave interviews and appeared on the magazine covers of Billboard,[12] Interview,[76] Elle,[77] The Face,[15] NME,[13] Nylon,[78] and Variety.[18] On May 25, Rodrigo appeared on Vevo Lift to perform \"Favorite Crime\".[79]On June 29, 2021, a livestream concert film entitled Sour Prom aired on Rodrigo's YouTube channel, in celebration of Sour's success. It featured songs from the album performed in various locations, such as \"the back of a limo, on a prom dancefloor, in a darkroom, and accompanied by a marching band on a football field.\"[80] She also hosted a \"pre-party\" Q&A segment in which she answered questions on the album's creation. She then performed several live renditions of her Sour tracks, including \"Drivers License\" and \"Good 4 U\".[81] The film was described as \"the ultimate alternative prom experience\", after Rodrigo herself graduated high school recently.[82] The concert film later was nominated at the 2021 UK Music Video Awards in the category 'Best Special Video Project'.[83]On February 17, 2022, Rodrigo announced a documentary about Sour, titled Driving Home 2 U (A Sour Film), releasing to Disney+ on March 25, 2022. It was directed by Stacey Lee and produced by Interscope Films and Supper Club. According to a press release, the film captures Rodrigo's road trip from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, during which she began writing Sour. The film includes \"new live arrangements of her songs, intimate interviews, and never-before-seen footage from the making of the album.\"[84]To support Sour, Rodrigo has embarked on the Sour Tour, her first headlining concert tour. It covers North America and Europe with 47 dates. It commenced on April 5, 2022, in Portland, Oregon, and is set to conclude on July 7, 2022, in London. Gracie Abrams and Holly Humberstone are the opening acts for the North American dates, and Baby Queen for European dates.[85] On the tour, Rodrigo covered Avril Lavigne's \"Complicated\" at all tour dates. At the Toronto show in Canada on April 29, Lavigne joined Rodrigo as a surprise guest on stage to perform the song together for the first time.[86][87]Sour received widespread critical acclaim upon release, appearing on multiple year ends lists.[94] The general consensus was that the album is a strong debut record that mounts Rodrigo as the new face of \"Gen Z pop\".[95] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from publications, the album received a mean score of 83 based on 20 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89]Robin Murray of Clash hailed Sour as a \"bravura\" pop statement \"marked by excellence from front to back\". He described its 11 tracks as \"potential smash hit singles\", and complimented Rodrigo's bold lyricism, punchy execution, deeming her \"pop's newest icon, and one of its bravest voices\".[92] The A.V. Club's Tatiana Tenreyro designated Sour a contender for best pop album of 2021, and highlighted its lack of filler tracks. She stated each song depicts a different side to Rodrigo's artistry, embracing influences while still creating \"something fresh\".[96] Kate Solomon, writing for i, called Sour a \"surprisingly accomplished package\" and a \"stunning portrait of adolescence\".[97] NME critic Rhian Daly called Rodrigo a \"multidimensional\" artist writing detailed songs that \"go full-circle from being precisely personal to universally relatable\".[25]Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph opined Sour excels in modern production, striking an acoustic-electronic balance by combining Taylor Swift's traditional songcraft, Lorde's harmonies and Billie Eilish's whispery vocals with the brashness of Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne.[19] Also touching on these comparisons, fellow critic Robert Christgau said Rodrigo \"recalls her hero Taylor more than her West Coast homegirl Billie with bravely retro pre-track-and-hook structures and lyrics that map out the kind of emotional grounding all parents pray their kids achieve, the female ones especially\".[98] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times dubbed the album \"flawless Gen Z pop\" that ranges from crisp 1990s rock to acoustic balladry, and \"the most self-aware pop record in recent memory\".[27] Entertainment Weekly's Maura Johnston felt Sour's heaviness is bettered by Rodrigo's grace and self-awareness, and that she is not trying to be \"the next\" anyone, but instead distills her life and musical tastes into promising, \"powerful, hooky pop\".[24] Rolling Stone critic Angie Martoccio said, beyond her idols and inspirations, Rodrigo forged \"a path into an entirely new realm of pop\" in Sour, where she is \"unapologetically and enthusiastically her own guide\".[30]Variety's Chris Williman called Sour \"ridiculously good\", and \"unabashedly teenage\" atypical of most teen singers who often try to mimick adult music.[99] Praising Rodrigo's musical vision and Nigro's production, Rachel Saywitz, reviewing for The Line of Best Fit, said Sour swerves the conventional genres to work Rodrigo's wide taste.[100] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it a \"nuanced and often exceptional debut album\", traversing Rodrigo's evolving perspectives real-time.[101] The Independent critic Helen Brown thought Sour converts 21st-century adolescence into universally resonating \"story-songs\", and admired Rodrigo's \"disarming honesty\", using F-bombs unlike former teen stars who \"don't usually do that until they're onto the post-breakdown record\". She added its organic musicality breaks the \"shiny surfaces we've come to expect from such glossy girls.\"[93]Olivia Horn of Pitchfork called it a \"nimble and lightly chaotic collection of breakup tunes filled with melancholy and mischief\", with profanity typically prohibited by the morality clauses limiting Disney singers. However, Horn stated  Rodrigo is \"more invested in content than in craft\" at moments, settling for simple rhymes, self-evident phrasing, and a DIY recording quality that exposes imperfections in Rodrigo's voice.[29] Rachel Aroesti of The Guardian said Sour is polished \"pop euphoria\" that processes anger, jealousy and bewilderment, and is \"one of the most gratifyingly undignified breakup albums ever made\", but nevertheless, majority of it follows the style of \"Drivers License\", resulting in a lovely and thoughtful but unadventurous record.[41] Stereogum's Chris DeVille stated, though Rodrigo's lyrics \"can come off desperate and immature\" while the album's pace can be a \"wearisome slog\" at times, Sour works by weaponizing its drawbacks.[102] Regarding the album \"a youthful tour through heartbreak angst\" that weakens only when it \"plays too safe\", DIY's Jenessa Williams felt Rodrigo's \"truly soars\" when she heads strong, rather than victimizing herself in \"bitterness\".[103]Rodrigo received seven nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Sour; Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Drivers License\"; and Best New Artist. She became the second youngest artist (18 years old) to be nominated for all four of the general categories in the same ceremony, after Billie Eilish (17, for the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020).[104] Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent were nominated for Album of the Year for Sour as songwriters credited for interpolation, but subsequently withdrawn by the Recording Academy as they were \"not actively involved\" in creating Sour.[105]Numerous critics and publications listed Sour in their year-end ranking of the best albums of 2021, often inside the top-ten.Sour was the most pre-added album on Apple Music during the week leading up to its release (May 14, 2021 to May 20, 2021), dethroning Billie Eilish's Happier Than Ever (2021).[119] Upon release, Sour garnered 385 million streams in its first week on global Spotify\u2014the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist on the platform, beating the former record set by Ariana Grande's Thank U, Next (2019).[120] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that Rodrigo was the world's fourth best-selling female artist of 2021, behind Swift, Adele and Eilish.[121]Following the debuts of \"Drivers License\" and \"Good 4 U\" at the number one spot of the US Billboard Hot 100, Sour became the first debut album in history to have two songs debut atop the chart, and overall the fourth album to do so.[122]Sour debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with 295,000 album-equivalent units, of which 72,000 were album sales,[123] and spent a total of five weeks at the spot, becoming the longest reigning number-one album by a female artist in 2021.[124][note 1] At the time, the 295,000 sum marked the biggest opening week for any album in 2021.

Of that sum, 76,000 were vinyl LPs, scoring the second-largest vinyl album sales week in MRC Data history, placing behind Swift's Evermore (2020).[124]All 11 of Sour's tracks appeared in the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 dated June 5, 2021. Rodrigo is the first female artist, and the fourth act overall, to simultaneously chart 11 or more songs in the chart's top 30. Three songs charted in the top 10: \"Good 4 U\" at number two, down from number one the previous week, \"Deja Vu\" reaching a new peak of number three, and \"Traitor\" entering at number nine, making her the first artist in Hot 100 history to have three songs from their debut album to chart simultaneously in the top 10; \"Traitor\" marked the album's fourth top-10 song and fourth to debut in the top ten.[59][133] Eight of the album's tracks entered the top 10 of Billboard Streaming Songs chart, breaking the record for the most simultaneous top-10 entries on the chart.[134] \"Brutal\" debuted atop Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, marking the first number-one debut on the chart since Swift's \"Cardigan\" (2020).[135]As of October 2021, Sour amassed 2.35 million units in the US,[136] making it the best-selling album of 2021 by a female artist so far, and second overall, behind Dangerous: The Double Album.

It also marked the biggest opening week for a debut album since Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent (2019). With \"Good 4 U\" rising to the top spot of the UK Singles Chart concurrently, Rodrigo became the youngest soloist in UK history to achieve a Chart Double, at 18 years and 3 months old.

The album received 45.7 million streams (30,945 album-equivalent units) in its opening week.[140] When \"Traitor\" reached a new peak of number 5 on the UK Singles, Rodrigo became the first female artist in history to occupy three spots in the top 5 simultaneously, with \"Deja Vu\" at number 4, and \"Good 4 U\" spending a third consecutive week at the top.[141][142] Sour spent five non-consecutive weeks atop the chart.[143] By the end of the year, Sour spent a total of 32 weeks inside of the Top 20.[144]Sour was the UK's most streamed album of 2021 with 83% of its year-end sum of 395,000 units being on-demand streams.

Cole's The Off-Season (2021). Sour garnered the biggest opening-week of streams for a debut album in history, surpassing Eilish's When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019). Rodrigo achieved a chart-double in Ireland, as \"Good 4 U\" held on to its number-one spot on the Irish Singles Chart for a second consecutive week. \"Deja Vu\" rose to a new peak of number 2, while \"Traitor\" entered at number 3, marking the first time a female artist occupied all the top 3 spots of the singles chart in the same week.[152] Sour spent its first seven weeks atop the Irish Albums Chart, claiming the longest consecutive reign at number one by an album by a female artist since Adele's 21 (2011).[153] It was the best-selling album of the first half of 2021 in Ireland,[154] and spent 20 non-consecutive weeks at number one.[155]On the New Zealand Albums Chart, Sour arrived at number one,[156] aside five of its songs reaching the top 10 of the New Zealand Singles Chart; \"Good 4 U\", \"Deja Vu\", \"Traitor\", \"Drivers License\" and \"Brutal\" charted at numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8, respectively.[157] Sour spent ten consecutive weeks at number one, and is the only album by a female artist other than Adele's 21 to do so.[158]Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.[3] All tracks were produced by Dan Nigro, except where noted.Credits adapted from the liner notes of Sour.[3]* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\u00a0 Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Brit_Award": "The BRIT Awards (often simply called the BRITs) are the British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards. The name was originally a shortened form of \"British\", \"Britain\", or \"Britannia\" (in the early days the awards were sponsored by Britannia Music Club), but subsequently became a backronym for British Record Industry Trusts Show.[1] In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, is held in May. The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry's trade association, the BPI. In 1989, they were renamed The BRIT Awards.[2] Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event.[3]The highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.[4][5][6][7] These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being \u201ca little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic\u201d with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and \u201cevolved into a more polished, sanitised affair.\u201d[8]The BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed.[9] From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV.[9] That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act.[9] For the last time, on 16 February 2010, the venue for The BRITs was the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London. The BRIT Awards were held at the O2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.[10]The BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by some of the best known British designers, stylists and artists, including Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid, Anish Kapoor and David Adjaye.[11][12][13][14] In 1992, KLF opened the show and invited extreme metal band Extreme Noise Terror on stage, complete with flame-throwers, and fired machine gun blanks over the crowd. The group sent a dead sheep to the aftershow party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry.[8] Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That.[15] Girl group Little Mix made history at the 2021 Brit Awards, when they became the first female group to receive the award for Best Group at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced.[16]The first awards ceremony was in 1977, as \"The BRITish Record Industry BRITannia Awards\", to mark the Queen's Silver Jubilee and was televised by Thames Television. There has been an annual ceremony since 1982.The 1988 BPI Awards was the first of the ceremonies to be broadcast on live television. The BBC had previously broadcast the ceremony from 1985, with the shows from 1982 to 1984 not broadcast on television. The BBC continued to broadcast the renamed BRIT Awards, live in 1989 and pre-recorded from 1990 to 1992. ITV have broadcast the awards since 1993, pre-recorded until 2006 and live from 2007 onwards.[9] BBC Radio 1 has provided backstage radio coverage since 2008.Since 2014, ITV have aired a launch show in January titled The BRITs Are Coming, which reveals some of the artists who have been nominated at the upcoming ceremony. The first host was Nick Grimshaw, followed by Reggie Yates (2015) and Laura Whitmore in 2016. Emma Willis hosted The BRITs Are Coming in 2017 and again in 2018 when it was broadcast live for the first time. Clara Amfo hosted the 2019 launch show and Alice Levine hosted in 2020. Amfo later returned and was joined by Maya Jama as co-host in December 2021.The first ceremony in 1977 was broadcast by Thames Television.[17] Ceremonies were not held from 1978 to 1981, and at first were not televised after resuming in 1982.From 1989 to 1992, the ceremonies were broadcast on the BBC. Since 1993, they have been broadcast on ITV.In 1987 the BPI Awards ceremony was held in the Great Room at the Grosvenor House Hotel. At the time there was a BBC electricians' strike in effect, and the organisers decided to use a non-TV events production company, called Upfront, to manage the show. Despite the show being picketed, the event was transmitted as intended. For a while, the outdoor broadcast scanner was rocked on its wheels by the protesters and they managed to shut off the power to one of the big GE video screen projectors. Upfront was then asked to organise the following year and persuaded the BPI to move the event to a larger venue, starting the trend that continues to this day, albeit at The O2, and with a different production company (MJK Productions).In 1989, the ceremony was broadcast live and presented by Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood and singer Samantha Fox. The inexperience of the hosts, an ineffective autocue, and little preparation combined to create an unprofessional show that was poorly received.[18] The hosts continually got their lines mixed up, a pre-recorded message from Michael Jackson was never transmitted and several guest stars arrived late on stage or at the wrong time, such as Boy George in place of The Four Tops.In accepting the award for Best British Group from Boy George at the 1989 awards, Andy Bell of Erasure kissed George on stage to cheers from the crowd, with Bell stating it was an act in protest against Section 28 introduced by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government that prohibited the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools.[18]The 1990 awards ceremony saw the last public appearance of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.[19] Queen appeared at the ceremony to receive the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.[19][20] Mercury (who had been suffering from AIDS since 1987 but had not disclosed it to the public) did not make a speech, as Brian May did the talking on behalf of the other members, but his gaunt appearance was noticeable.[21]In 1992, dance/art band The KLF was awarded Best British Group (shared with Simply Red) and were booked to open the show. In an attempt to hijack the event, the duo collaborated with grindcore metal band Extreme Noise Terror to perform a death metal version of the dance song \"3 a.m. Eternal\", a performance that prompted conductor Sir Georg Solti to walk out in disgust.[22] The performance ended with Bill Drummond firing blanks from a vintage machine gun over the audience and KLF publicist/announcer Scott Piering stating \"Ladies and gentlemen, The KLF have now left the music business\".[23] Producers of the show then refused to let a motorcycle courier collect the award on behalf of the band.[24] Later that evening, the KLF dumped a dead sheep outside the venue of an after-show party,[23][24] whilst their Brit Award was reportedly found buried in a field near Stonehenge in 1993.[8]In 1996, Michael Jackson was given a special Artist of a Generation award. At the ceremony he accompanied his single \"Earth Song\" with a stage show, culminating with Jackson as a 'Christ-like figure' surrounded by children. Jarvis Cocker, of the band Pulp, mounted the stage in what he would later claim as a protest at this portion of the performance.[18] Cocker ran across the stage, lifting his shirt and pointing his (clothed) backside in Jackson's direction. Cocker was subsequently questioned by the police but was told he would not be prosecuted.[18]Regarding his actions, Cocker said, \"My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn't make any contact with anyone as far as I recall.\"[25]1996 saw the height of a well-documented feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands.[26] Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 BRIT Awards by singing a rendition of \"Parklife\" when they collected their award for Best British Group (with Liam changing the lyrics to \"Shite-life\" and Noel changing them to \"Marmite\").[8]\"There's no denying they're a lot slicker, a lot tamer now than they were in their '80s and '90s heyday. Will we ever see another stage invasion, a politician getting a soaking, or one of the country's biggest stars offering another out for a fight? Probably not.\"\u2014Gemma Peplow, entertainment reporter for Sky News, Brit Awards 2021: From Geri to Jarvis - the biggest moments in show's history.[18]In 1998, Danbert Nobacon of the politically active band Chumbawamba threw a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Despite apologies on behalf of the band from EMI Europe, Chumbawamba were unrepentant, saying, \"If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the Brit Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.\"[27]Some controversy was caused by the host of the 2007 awards ceremony, comedian Russell Brand, who made several quips relating to news stories of the time including Robbie Williams entering rehab for addiction to prescription drugs, the Queen's 'naughty bits' and a fatal friendly fire incident involving a British soldier killed by American armed forces in Iraq. ITV received over 300 complaint calls from viewers.[28] He would again instigate controversy the following year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.Adele won the award for British Album of the Year, widely regarded as the most important award. Less than half a minute into her acceptance speech, host James Corden was forced to cut Adele off in order to introduce Blur who were due to perform an eleven-minute set as they had won the Outstanding Contribution to Music award and the ceremony was running over its allotted time.[29] Adele was visibly annoyed and proceeded to raise her middle finger[30] and the producers of the show came under fire on Twitter for the decision.[31] Following the incident Adele said \"I got cut off during my speech for Best Album and I flung the middle finger. But that finger was to the suits at The BRIT Awards, not to my fans\".[32] Adele received an apology from the show's organisers, who stated; \"We send our deepest apologies to Adele that her big moment was cut short. We don't want this to undermine her incredible achievement in winning our night's biggest award. It tops off what's been an incredible year for her.\"[33] Due to the tight schedule, only three of the five songs Blur played were broadcast on ITV.At 67 years of age, the influential musician David Bowie became the oldest recipient to date of the Best British Male Solo Artist Award.[34] Bowie used his acceptance speech, delivered in his absence by Kate Moss, to urge Scotland to remain part of the UK in the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum. His speech read: \"I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male \u2013 but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us.\"[35] Bowie's unusual intervention in British politics garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.[34][36]Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell, wore a Union Jack dress.[6][37][38][39] Spicemania was at its height in the UK and the Spice Girls had just cracked the US as well, reaching number 1 with their debut single and album. \nHalliwell was originally going to wear an all-black dress, but she thought it was too boring so her sister sewed on a Union Jack tea towel, with a 'peace' sign on the back. The now iconic red, white and blue mini-dress was worn during the Spice Girls' performance of their number one song \"Who Do You Think You Are\".[40] In 1998 she sold her dress in a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record \u00a341,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold.[41] This performance won the Spice Girls the award for \"BRITs Hits 30 \u2013 Best Live Performance at The BRIT Awards\" at the 2010 BRIT Awards, with Samantha Fox presenting the award to Geri Halliwell and Mel B.[42]Three years following the iconic Spice Girls performance, Halliwell, now a solo artist, performed her new single \"Bag It Up\" at the 2000 BRIT Awards. The performance featured Halliwell emerging, whilst dancing on with a pole, from a pair of large inflatable female legs. As the performance continued, her male backing dancers stripped to their pink briefs whilst dancing with the Union Jack flag. It is widely believed that Halliwell lip-synced her performance. In addition to all this, the performance is famous for being performed on the same night that the Spice Girls received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, which Halliwell declined to accept with her former bandmates.When it was announced that past Brit Award recipient Damon Albarn, and his project Gorillaz, would be taking the stage at the 2002 Brit Awards, no one knew what to expect.  The four cartoon members of the band performed the song on giant life size screens (an early version of a 3D hologram) without the Blur frontman being present at all.[43] The band performed their hit single \"Clint Eastwood\" alongside UK underground rap group Phi Life Cypher and a group of silhouetted female dancers mimicking the zombies from the band's music video.[43] The performance received rapturous cheers and applause.[44]English-Irish girl group Girls Aloud marked their first ever performance at the 2009 ceremony, by performing their single \"The Promise\". The performance saw the members, Cheryl Cole, Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Nadine Coyle appear as though they were naked, with their modesty being covered by pink feather fans. This performance was nominated in the 2010 ceremony for the \"BRITs Hits 30 \u2013 Best Live Performance at The BRIT Awards\", alongside Oasis and The Who, which the Spice Girls eventually went on to win.[42]Adele performed her song \"Someone like You\" at the 2011 BRITs with only a piano accompanying her. Her emotional performance was received with a standing ovation at the O2 Arena and the video has received 187 million views so far on YouTube. The performance launched \"Someone Like You\" 46 spots up the UK charts to number one, and in the process, made Adele the first artist in the UK since The Beatles to have two top five singles and two top five albums at the same time. The performance had all lights down and focused on Adele and her piano.[38]Madonna's live return to BRIT Awards after 20 years was widely promoted in the media in the days leading up to the ceremony and during the show itself.[45] During the performance of \"Living for Love\", she walked onstage wearing an oversized cape. When standing on stairs situated on the stage, the cape's cord failed to separate, so when Madonna's backing dancer pulled the cape behind her, she fell down the stairs and noticeably hit the stage hard.[46] She paused momentarily as her backing music continued, before she managed to separate herself from the cape and then continued performing.[47] In an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, Madonna blamed her fall on a wardrobe malfunction as her cape had been tied too tightly so it could not be unfastened in time, before adding: \"I had a little bit of whiplash, I smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3am to make sure I was compos mentis. I know how to fall, I have fallen off my horse many times.\"[37][38][46]In the leadup to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Katy Perry was a major endorsement for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, performing at many of her rallies and speaking at public events. After Donald Trump won the election, Perry returned to recording her fifth studio album and in February 2017 released \"Chained to the Rhythm\". During the performance, she was joined onstage by two large skeletal puppets dressed as Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May.[48] The performance was also notable as a backing dancer fell offstage at the end of the performance whilst wearing a house costume.[49][37]During Anne-Marie's performance of \"Kiss My (Uh-Oh)\", she stepped out of a giant model of a heart but while she was stepping down the stairs, she let go of one of her dancer's hands and tripped. People compared the scene to a \"Madonna moment\" and Anne-Marie herself joked about it on Twitter saying: \"Didn't need my left ankle anyway.\"[50]According to The BRIT Awards website, the list of eligible artists, albums, and singles is compiled by the Official Charts Company and submitted to the voting academy, which consists of over 1,000 members of the music industry, including the previous year's nominees and winners. The voters use a secure online website to vote, and the voting is scrutinized by Electoral Reform Services.[51] The concept of fan voting was abolished after the 2019 Brit Awards.[52]Coldplay is the act with most performances ever, with five opening presentations and eight overall, followed by Take That and band member Robbie Williams, who performed seven times each. Adele has performed at five ceremonies, the most amongst female artists.There have been numerous acts, both groups and individuals, that have won multiple awards. The table below shows those that have won four or more awards.[53][54][55][56]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Grammy_Awards": "The Grammy Award (stylized as GRAMMY, originally called Gramophone Award), or just Grammy, is an award presented by the Recording Academy to recognize \"Outstanding Achievement in the music industry\" of the United States. The trophy depicts a gilded gramophone.The Grammys are the first of the Big Three networks' major music awards held annually (before the Billboard Music Awards in Summer and the American Music Awards in Fall).The Grammy is considered one of the four major annual American entertainment awards, along with the Academy Awards (for film achievements), the Emmy Awards (for television achievements), and the Tony Awards (for theater achievements).The first Grammy Awards ceremony was held on May 4, 1959, to honor the musical accomplishments of performers for the year 1958. After the 2011 ceremony, The Recording Academy overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012.[1] The sixty-fourth annual Grammy Awards took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022.folkloreWE AREThe Grammys had their origin in the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the 1950s.[2][3] As recording executives on the Walk of Fame committee compiled a list of significant recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized that many leading people in their business would not earn a star on Hollywood Boulevard. They determined to rectify this by creating awards given by their industry similar to the Oscars and the Emmys. After deciding to go forward with such awards, a question remained what to call them. One working title was the \u2018Eddie\u2019, to honor Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonograph. Eventually, the name was chosen after a mail-in contest whereby approximately 300 contestants submitted the name 'Grammy', with the earliest postmark from contest winner Jay Danna of New Orleans, Louisiana, as an abbreviated reference Emile Berliner's invention, the gramophone.[4] Grammys were first awarded for achievements in 1958.[5][6][7]The first award ceremony was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959, the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City, New York,[8] with 28 Grammys awarded. The number of awards given grew, at one time reaching over 100, and fluctuated over the years with categories added and removed.[9] The second Grammy Awards, also held in 1959, was the first ceremony to be televised,[10] but the ceremony was not aired live until the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971.[11]The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music recorded in Spanish or Portuguese began in 1989,[12][13] as it was deemed too large to fit on the regular Grammys ceremony.[14] The Recording Academy then established the Latin Recording Academy in 1997, and the separate Latin Grammy Awards were first held in 2000. The Latin Grammys honor works recorded in Spanish or Portuguese from anywhere around the world that has been released either in Ibero-America, the Iberian Peninsula, or the United States.[15]The 63rd Annual Grammy Awards were postponed from its original January 31, 2021 date to March 14, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry.[16][17]The 64th Annual Grammy Awards were also postponed from its original January 31, 2022 date to April 3, 2022, due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Omicron variant.[18] The ceremony was also moved from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas due to the former having scheduling conflicts with sports games and concerts nearly every night through mid-April.[19]The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a gilded gramophone, are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in Ridgway, Colorado. In 1990, the original Grammy design was reworked, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander.[20] Billings developed Grammium, a zinc alloy which they trademarked.[21] Trophies engraved with each recipient's name are not available until after the award announcements, so \"stunt\" trophies are re-used each year for the ceremony broadcast.[22][23]By February 2009, some 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.[24]The \"General Field\" are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.Among three artists who have won all four awards, two won all four at once: Christopher Cross in 1981, and Billie Eilish in 2020, making her, at age 18, the youngest artist to do so. Adele won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and her other three awards in 2012 and 2017.Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres and for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are also given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.Because of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013, and 82 in 2014), and a desire to feature several performances by various artists, only awards with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four general field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e., pop, rock, country, and rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. Most other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast \"Premiere Ceremony\" in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.On April 6, 2011, the Recording Academy announced a significant overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.[25] The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, rhythm and blues [R&B], country, and rap). Additionally, several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued; recordings in these categories now fall under general categories for best solo performances.In the rock field, the hard rock and metal album categories were combined. The Best Rock Instrumental Performance category also was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.In R&B, the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated, consolidated into one Best R&B Album category.[26]In rap, the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new Best Rap Performance category.The roots category had the most eliminations. Up through 2011, there were separate categories for regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian, Native American, and Zydeco/Cajun music. A consistently low number of entries in these categories lead the Recording Academy to combine these music variations into a new Best Regional Roots Music Album, including polka, which had lost its category in 2009.[27][28]In same-genre fields, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and the challenges to distinguish between contemporary and traditional blues and folk songs. In the world music field, the traditional and contemporary categories also were merged.In the classical field, its main category Best Classical Album was discontinued because most recipients in the category had also won in other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main Album of the Year category.A few minor name changes were also made to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. The Recording Academy determined that the word \"gospel\" in the gospel genre field tends to connote images and sounds of traditional soul gospel to the exclusion of Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Therefore, the field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.[29]Since 2012, small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has risen from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 2017.[30] In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, several urban, rap, and Latin music categories were renamed.[31]Members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), both media companies and individuals, may nominate recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. When a work is entered, review sessions are held that involve over 150 recording industry experts, to determine that the work has been entered in the correct category.The resulting lists of eligible entries are then circulated to voting members, each who may vote to nominate in the general fields (Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist) and in up to nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) review committees determine the final five nominees.[32] There may be over five nominees if a tie occurs in the nomination process.Although members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences generally are invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings, but instead receive access to a private online listening service.After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in up to nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the independent accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.[32] After vote tabulation, winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two [or more] nominees who tie are considered winners). Winners are presented with a Grammy Award; those who do not win receive a medal for their nomination.In both voting rounds, academy members are required to vote solely based upon quality, without consideration for sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. Gifts may not be accepted. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries, they have no vote in the process.The eligibility period for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards was September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020.In many categories, certificates are presented to those ineligible for a Grammy award but who did contribute to a winning recording. These certificates are known as Participation Certificates or Winners Certificates. Those eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks after the Grammy ceremony.From time to time, a special Grammy Award of merit is awarded to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\".[33] It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies.  As of 2018,[update] only fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.The Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovative contributions to the music industry.[34][35] Recipients include:In past decades, remarks given by the president of The Recording Academy has been followed by an In Memoriam segment. The segment was aired in the broadcast's final hour, and later was preceded by the broadcast's final commercial break.Before 1971, Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally New York City and Los Angeles were the host cities. Chicago joined as a host city in 1962 and Nashville became a fourth location in 1965.The 1971 ceremony at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. In 1972, the ceremony was then moved to Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum in New York City, then moved in 1973 to Nashville's Tennessee Theatre. From 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles, including New York's Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall; and Los Angeles\u2019 Shrine Auditorium, Staples Center and Hollywood Palladium.In 2000, the Crypto.com Arena (known as the Staples Center from 1999 to 2021) became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. The Grammy Museum was built across the street from the Crypto.com Arena in LA Live to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks on the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to honor each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have taken place outside of Los Angeles only three times. New York City's Madison Square Garden hosted the awards in 2003 and in 2018, while the MGM Grand Garden Arena hosted in 2022.[36]The annual awards ceremony at the Crypto.com Arena requires that sports teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Sparks play an extended length of road games.With 31 Grammy Awards, Sir Georg Solti is the artist with the most Grammy wins.[37] Beyonc\u00e9 is the biggest winner among female artists and singers overall with 28 awards.[38] U2, with 22 Grammy Awards, holds the record for most awards won by a group.[39]When Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage: \"I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything.\"[40] In 2008 Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music \"that's fully industry based\". He said he was not that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards.[41] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of their awards, explaining that:[42]I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses. They don't honor the arts or the artist for what he created. It's the music business celebrating itself. That's basically what it's all about.The Grammys have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful ones.[43][44] In 1991, Sinead O'Connor became the first musician to refuse a Grammy, boycotting the ceremony after being nominated for Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance. O'Connor would go on to win the latter award.[45] She said her reasoning came from the Grammys' extreme commercialism.[46]The Grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists. The organization's awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by Voting Members of the Recording Academy and that Voting Members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process, such as performers, songwriters, producers, and engineers.[47]Nomination review committees, composed of anonymous industry figures, were established following the 37th Grammy Awards, which attracted criticism for the slate of Album of the Year nominations.[48][49] The winner, Tony Bennett's live album MTV Unplugged, competed against the live classical album The Three Tenors in Concert 1994, Seal's second eponymous album, and the twelfth albums from Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton, both longtime musical mainstays. Not nominated that year were several albums that would later be recognized as classics, including Nas's debut album Illmatic, Oasis's debut album Definitely Maybe, Hole's album Live Through This, Jeff Buckley's Grace, and the debut album from Wu-Tang Clan. The nomination review committees would be disbanded in 2021 following criticism of the lack of nominations for The Weeknd's album After Hours.[50]At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, artist Mariah Carey was nominated for six awards for her album Daydream, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for her single \"One Sweet Day\". Although critics believed Carey would be \"cleaning up\" that year, Carey ultimately lost in all her nominated categories that night, much to the shock of critics and Carey herself.[51] In 2011, Los Angeles Times journalist Randall Roberts criticized the exclusion of Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy from Album of the Year nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards. He described West's album as \"the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record\".[52] Roberts went on to criticize the Grammy Awards for being \"mired in the past\" and out of touch with \"new media\" and trends among music listeners such as music sharing, stating:[52]The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population...The focus is still on the old music industry model of cash-cow hits, major label investments and commercial radio...In an article for Time, journalist Tour\u00e9 also responded to the snub and expressed general displeasure with the awards, stating \"I don't pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye's masterpiece My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year.\"[53] He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to Kremlinology and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more \"mature\" hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate \"pop-friendly\" hip hop albums instead.[53]In a 2011 profile for The New York Times after the 53rd Grammy Awards, frontman Justin Vernon of indie band Bon Iver was asked about the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded:[54]You know, I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like \"I would go and I would\" \u2013 and I don't think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy \u2013 \"I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: \"Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important.\" That's what I would say.He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:[54][Ninety-eight] percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they're thinking that, and that they're hoping to get that award. And who is that award given by? It's like they think it's literally handed down by the musical-history gods. And I don't know who the voters are. Like, I have a friend who's a voter who was like, \"I had to be a voter because I don't trust the other voters.\" And I was like, \"Me either!\" And it's just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.[54] After winning, Vernon said in his acceptance, \"It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here.\"[55]In his article \"Everything Old Is Praised Again\", Jon Caramanica of The New York Times criticized Grammy voters for being \"conservative\" and disregarding more \"forward-looking\" music and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, \"for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change.\"[56] He cited the Grammy successes of Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Norah Jones' Come Away with Me (2003), and Adele's 21 (2011) as examples of \"the Grammys drop[ping] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album\". Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, \"He didn't even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized.\"[56]In an article for The Huffington Post, music executive and author Steve Stoute criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having \"lost touch with contemporary popular culture\" and noted \"two key sources\" for it: \"(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic.\"[57] Stoute accused the academy of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Kanye West's Graduation (2007) in the Album of the Year category. Stoute asserted that[57]As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of Steely Dan or Herbie Hancock, we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of Michael Jackson's Thriller in 1984.In 2020, Canadian artist Abel Tesfaye, known by his stage name The Weeknd, was shut out from the Grammys when his fourth studio album, After Hours, received no nominations at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. This came as a surprise to critics, fans, and Tesfaye himself, who had a successful run in 2020 with the success of both his album and the single \"Blinding Lights\". Tesfaye responded by social media calling the Grammys \"corrupt\".[58] Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance, as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B, contributed to the snubs.[59] Harvey Mason, Jr. responded by saying:We understand that The Weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated. I was surprised and can empathize with what he's feeling. His music this year was excellent, and his contributions to the music community and broader world are worthy of everyone\u2019s admiration. We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before. Unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists. But as the only peer-voted music award, we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community. To be clear, voting in all categories ended well before The Weeknd\u2019s performance at the Super Bowl was announced, so in no way could it have affected the nomination process. All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence, and we congratulate them all.[60]The Grammys' eligibility period runs from October 1 of one year until September 30 of the next year.[61] Records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time). This is despite the quarter falling during the Christmas and holiday season, when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving, and when Christmas music is at its natural peak.Fans unfamiliar with the Grammys voting window perennially hold a mistaken notion that a favorite artist has then been snubbed; for example, Adele's album 25 was released in November 2015 and thus was ineligible for nomination for the 2015 awards, despite its massive sales, earning its Grammys (including Album of the Year) instead in 2017.[62] Conversely, the Grammys often recognize work more than a year after it was released. Taylor Swift's 1989 won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album came out in October 2014.[63]The Grammys have also been accused of being unfavorable and racist to black recording artists. In a 2017 interview Canadian artist Drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage. He criticized the snubbing of \"One Dance\" for the Record of the Year award and the nomination of \"Hotline Bling\" for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, despite it not being a rap song.[64] The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\".[65] Drake did not attend the 2017 awards ceremony where he was nominated. He had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the ceremony. Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album Blonde for award consideration as a protest.[66]The Grammys were also criticized after the 59th Annual Grammy Awards when Adele's 25 (as mentioned above, released in late 2015) won Album of the Year over Beyonc\u00e9's album Lemonade (released in April 2016), which many music publications believed should have won the award. Steve Knopper of Rolling Stone magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and as well as for her pro-Black performance during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show.[67] USA Today also criticized Beyonc\u00e9's loss stating that \"Black artists have struggled to win album of the year\". They also felt 25 won only due to the album's record-breaking sales rather than having cultural significance and the large impact that Lemonade had in 2016.[68] Adele also expressed that Lemonade should have won over her for Album of the Year, stating in her acceptance speech:I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonc\u00e9. And this album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental. Beyonc\u00e9, it's so monumental. And so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-baring and we all got to see another side to you that you don't always let us see. And we appreciate that. And all us artists here adore you. You are our light.[69]In 2019, for the first time, rap artists won major award nominations outside the rap categories when Childish Gambino won the first Song and Record of the Year awards ever for a rap song.[70] Hispanic and Latino Americans (the largest America minority) are more under-represented at the Grammy Awards, and their music is prone to be shifted to the categories of the Latin Grammy Awards unless they have a mainstream following.[71][72]In April 2022, the late Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar was omitted from the In Memoriam segment, and the nation's domestic media criticized the Grammys and Oscars for their Western-centric view of artists receiving attention over those throughout the rest of the world.[73]The Grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically. Notably at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018, New Zealand singer Lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to Tom Petty but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the Album of the Year Award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance. Lorde's mother also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women.[74] After the 60th ceremony, several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist SZA who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories, and to the Best Pop Solo Performance category which included four female nominees but was won by Ed Sheeran.[75] In an interview, Neil Portnow, President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to \"step up\" in order to win awards. Portnow's comments drew criticism from many female musicians including Pink, Katy Perry, Vanessa Carlton, Sheryl Crow, Iggy Azalea, Halsey and Charli XCX.[76] They also prompted the hashtag #GrammysSoMale on social media.[77]Before the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019, singer Ariana Grande decided not to perform or attend that year's ceremony over a disagreement about the song choices for her performance. An anonymous source told Variety that Grande felt \"insulted\" when producers refused to let the singer perform her latest single \"7 Rings\".  They compromised by having her perform the song as part of a medley, but the condition that the producers choose the second song lead Grande to withdraw from  the show. The source said that the same stipulations were not imposed on other performers.[78] Grande later accused Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich of lying about why she dropped out of the show. Ehrlich had said that Grande \"felt it was too late for her to pull something together\". Grande responded:I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken; it was when my creativity and self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.[79]Despite the controversy, Grande won for Best Pop Vocal Album and in 2020 performed at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards when nominated for five awards, including Album of the Year, but won none.[80] Despite past controversies, female artists dominated the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, with the big four awards being awarded entirely to women. Several women also broke records at that ceremony.[81]In May 2018, it was revealed that money intended for the Recording Academy charity MusiCares was siphoned off to pay for the cost overruns of hosting the 60th Annual Grammy Awards at New York City's Madison Square Garden.[82] Concerning the controversies of hosting that year's Grammy Awards in New York, Dana Tomarken, the former executive vice president of the MusiCares foundation claimed wrongful termination. She alleges that she was fired for pushing back against the academy's \"boys club\". She claimed that by having the MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute to Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall, the event had to forgo its traditional VIP dinner and silent auction. She had already been offered a deal to have the event at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Barclays Center is owned by AEG, which competes directly with The Madison Square Garden Company which owns Madison Square Garden and Radio City. Irving Azoff who then had a joint venture with the Madison Square Garden Company told Tomarken that the event can not be held at Barclays and had to be held at Radio City. Oak View Group which is associated with Azoff received 300 of the highest price tickets to the MusiCares event at Radio City. Oak View Group was supposed to sell them as a package deal which also included tickets to the Grammy Awards itself. MusiCares was promised to received $1.5 million from those tickets according to Tomarken. Those 300 tickets were never sold and were then returned to MusiCares, which resulted in a loss.[83]Recording Academy CEO Deborah Dugan was placed on leave on January 16, 2020, after a complaint of bullying from a member of staff (according to an anonymous New York Times source), ten days before the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.[84] Dugan had complained internally, alleging a broken system of voting that was subject to conflicts of interest and unnecessary spending.[84] On the nominations for the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, she stated that the voting process was an \"outrageous conflict of interest\" with several nominated artists sitting on the voting boards of their prospective categories. She claimed that \"one artist who initially ranked 18 out of 20 in the 2019 'Song of the Year' category ended up with a nomination\". She also claimed that a few artists like Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande had the votes to be nominated for the category, but were ultimately omitted.[85]In 2020, comedy star Tiffany Haddish turned down the invitation to host the 63rd Grammy pre-telecast premiere ceremony when they said that she would have to pay her own way. In an exclusive interview with Variety, Haddish revealed that she was told to cover the cost of hair, makeup, and wardrobe for the three-hour event, adding, \"I don't know if this might mean I might not get nominated ever again, but I think it's disrespectful\". When contacted, The Recording Academy explained that the premiere Ceremony is not a CBS program and is hosted by the academy, a not-for-profit organization, meaning that artists, hosts and performers have to perform free every year. They also noted that the issue would have no impact in Haddish's future nomination.[86]In 2022, the Grammys were criticized for nominating, and subsequently awarding, Louis C.K. a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for his comedy special Sincerely Louis C.K. The album made light of, and included jokes about, the multiple sexual misconduct revelations he admitted to years earlier.[87][88]Before the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on ABC, a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called The Best on Record was broadcast on NBC. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series NBC Sunday Showcase, which normally was devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two venues. Television producer Pierre Cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.[89] CBS bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to Nashville, Tennessee; the American Music Awards were created for ABC by the late Dick Clark as a result.The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract, the network would also air a \"nominations concert\" special in the last week of November, where nominations would be released during a special exclusive to CBS, rather than at a traditional early-morning press conference to a multi-network press pool. This was ended after the 2016 concert due to low ratings and criticism about the announcement format, and as of the 2017 nominations, they have been revealed in a roundtable conversation with Recording Academy representatives during CBS Mornings. In 2016, the Grammys became the first awards show to be broadcast live in all US territories, and for decades, alongside the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Tony Awards, the shows have aired live in over 150 countries worldwide.From 2004 to 2019, the Grammys were held on the second Sunday of February (the week after the Super Bowl), with two exceptions: if that day was February 14 (Valentine's Day), it was moved to the following day; if it was a Winter Olympics year, it was held earlier on the last Sunday of January (the week before the Super Bowl). Starting in 2020, the Academy Awards ceremony would move back to the second Sunday of February, forcing the Grammys to move back to the last Sunday of January to avoid conflict with either the Oscars or the Super Bowl.[90] To allow enough time for preparation, the cutoff date for eligible recordings would move from September 30 to August 31. This change reduced the eligibility period for the 2020 awards to eleven months (October 1, 2018\u00a0\u2013  August 31, 2019), a month shorter than usual.[91]When the televised Grammys came into renown in 1975, a relationship between Grammy Award winners and subsequent record sales began.[111] However, it was not until after 1984 that Grammy recipients' records showed a substantial increase in sales. This was largely due to an agreement made by NARAS and the National Association of Record Merchandisers (NARM). Under this agreement \"record labels provided stickers, posters and other point-of-purchase material emblazoned 'Grammy Nominee' or 'Grammy Award Winner' that retailers could use to improve marketing effects.\"[111]Grammy Awards - History - FactsGrammy Award Facts==External links==",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist": "The Grammy Award for Best New Artist has been awarded since 1959.[1] Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for records released in the previous year. The award was not presented in 1967. The official guidelines are as follows: \"For a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist.\" Note that this is not necessarily the first album released by an artist; for example, Shelby Lynne won the award in 2001 after having already released six albums over 13 years.[2]The Best New Artist award has a reputation for being given to artists whose music industry success ends up being short-lived; it is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that the award itself brings a curse.[3][4] This viewpoint was expressed by former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff in a 2002 interview for VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders: \"We got two of the five Grammys \u2013 one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who's gotten it since.\"[5]The category is also notable for being the only category in which a Grammy Award was vacated; this occurred in 1990 after it was revealed that winners Milli Vanilli did not contribute their own vocals on their album, Girl You Know It's True.[6] The award was not then given to another artist.[7]Of the 54 acts who have won the award since its inception, 26 are solo female artists, 18 are duos or groups, and 12 are solo male artists. Of the solo male artists, half were given the award in its first decade; since 1970, only six solo male artists have won the award, the most recent being Chance the Rapper in 2017 (although 2015 winner Sam Smith later came to identify as non-binary). From 1997 to 2003, and again from 2018 to 2022, all the winners were solo female artists. Only five artists have won both Best New Artist and Album of the Year in the same year: Bob Newhart in 1961, Christopher Cross in 1981, Lauryn Hill in 1999, Norah Jones in 2003, and Billie Eilish in 2020. Of these, Cross, Jones, and Eilish had songs winning Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the same year, with Cross as the sole songwriter, Eilish as co-writer, and Jones lacking songwriting credit, which therefore made her miss out on completing the single year big four Grammy achievement, a feat that only Cross and Eilish attained; while Adele was the only artist to win all General field Grammys from separate occasions. Only two artists have lost Best New Artist yet won Album of the Year in the same year: Vaughn Meader in 1963 and Alanis Morissette in 1996.Of all the winners, only three have been country artists. In 1997, LeAnn Rimes became the first country artist and (at age 14) the youngest artist to win the award.[8][9][10] She was followed by Carrie Underwood in 2007[10][11] and Zac Brown Band in 2010.[12] Additionally, 2017 marked the first time that two country artists were nominated in this category in the same year, in which Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini were both nominated.[13] In 2018, Alessia Cara became the first Canadian artist to ever win the award, and the only woman to win a major category that year. In 2020, Rosal\u00eda became the first all Spanish-language artist to be nominated. 2021 marked the first time that multiple female rappers were nominated in the same year, when Chika, Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion were all nominated, with the latter winning the award.For the award's first several years of existence, comedians and comic acts were regularly nominated, and one, Bob Newhart, won the award. However, this ended abruptly after 1963, and since then, only one comedian has been nominated for the award: Robin Williams in 1980. (That same year, the semi-comic act The Blues Brothers was also nominated.)David Crosby and Carl Palmer hold the distinction of being the only artists to be nominated twice for this award. Palmer was nominated both times as a member of a supergroup: Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Asia, while Crosby was nominated as a member of The Byrds and won as a member of the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash.1984 marked the first time that all of the nominees were from outside the United States (winner Culture Club, Eurythmics, Musical Youth, and Big Country were from the United Kingdom, and Men Without Hats were from Canada).[14]Eight artists who have been nominated for Best New Artist and have been later awarded with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award: The Beatles (1965, 2014), Chicago (1970, 2020), Cream (1969, 2006), Jefferson Airplane (1968, 2016), Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim (1965, 2012), Led Zeppelin, (1970, 2005), Leontyne Price (1961, 1989), and John Prine (1972, 2020).Members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominate their choices for the best new artist. A list of the top twenty artists is given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who initially selected the top five artists to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot; the number of nominated artists was increased to eight in 2018.[15][16] The rest of the members then vote on a winner from the final nominees.[17]Over the years, the eligibility rules for this category have changed several times. In 2010, Lady Gaga's exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the Recording Academy to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit \"Just Dance\" had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist may be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire album and has subsequently not won a Grammy.[18][19] In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier \u201cgiven current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted\u201d.[20] To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:These new rules were put in effect with the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. The category was then expanded to include eight nominees in 2019.[21] Starting in 2021, screening committees were charged with determining whether the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence prior to the eligibility year. Such a determination would result in disqualification.[22]^[I]  Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.^[II]  The Grammy Award for Best New Artist wasn't presented during the 9th Grammy Awards.[85][86]^[III]  Milli Vanilli were originally presented with the award on February 21, 1990, but were later stripped of it after admitting that they weren't the original singers on their album.[6] The category was left vacant for the year.GeneralSpecific",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Time_(magazine)": "Time (stylized in all caps) is an American news magazine and news website published and based in New York City. For nearly a century, it was published weekly, but starting in March 2020 it transitioned to every other week.[2] It was first published in New York City on March 3, 1923, and for many years it was run by its influential co-founder, Henry Luce. A European edition (Time Europe, formerly known as Time Atlantic) is published in London and also covers the Middle East, Africa, and, since 2003, Latin America. An Asian edition (Time Asia) is based in Hong Kong.[3] The South Pacific edition, which covers Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is based in Sydney.As of 2012, Time had a circulation of 3.3\u00a0million, making it the 11th-most-circulated magazine in the United States and the second-most-circulated weekly behind People. In July 2017, its circulation was 3,028,013; this was cut down to 2\u00a0million by late 2017. The print edition has a readership of 1.6\u00a0million, 1\u00a0million of whom are based in the United States.[citation needed]Formerly published by New York City-based Time Inc., since November 2018 Time has been published by Time USA, LLC, owned by Marc Benioff, who acquired it from Meredith Corporation.Time has been based in New York City since its first issue published on March 3, 1923, by Briton Hadden and Henry Luce. It was the first weekly news magazine in the United States.[4] The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor, respectively, of the Yale Daily News. They first called the proposed magazine Facts, wanting to emphasize brevity so a busy man could read it in an hour. They changed the name to Time and used the slogan \"Take Time\u00a0\u2013 It's Brief\".[5] Hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease Luce. He saw Time as important but also fun, which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities and politicians, the entertainment industry and pop culture, criticizing it as too light for serious news.Time set out to tell the news through people, and until the late 1960s, the magazine's cover depicted a single person. More recently, Time has incorporated \"People of the Year\" issues which grew in popularity over the years. The first issue of Time featured Joseph G. Cannon, the retired Speaker of the House of Representatives, on its cover; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the magazine's issue from February 28, 1938, in commemoration of its 15th anniversary.[6] The cover price was 15\u00a2 (equivalent to $2.39 in 2021). On Hadden's death in 1929, Luce became the dominant man at Time and a major figure in the history of 20th century media. According to Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1972\u20132004 by Robert Elson, \"Roy Edward Larsen\u00a0... was to play a role second only to Luce's in the development of Time Inc\". In his book The March of Time, 1935\u20131951, Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was \"originally circulation manager and then general manager of Time, later publisher of Life, for many years president of Time Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce\".[citation needed]Around the time they were raising $100,000 from wealthy Yale alumni such as Henry P. Davison, partner of J.P. Morgan & Co., publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan & Co. banker Dwight Morrow; Henry Luce and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922\u00a0\u2013 although Larsen was a Harvard graduate and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates. After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling RKO stock he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the Benjamin Franklin Keith theater chain in New England. However, after Briton Hadden's death, the largest Time, Inc. stockholder was Henry Luce, who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion; \"at his right hand was Larsen\", Time's second-largest stockholder, according to Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923\u20131941. In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and vice president. J. P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over Time and Fortune. Other shareholders were Brown Brothers W. A. Harriman & Co., and the New York Trust Company (Standard Oil).[citation needed]The Time Inc. stock owned by Luce at the time of his death was worth about $109\u00a0million, and it had been yielding him a yearly dividend of more than $2.4\u00a0million, according to Curtis Prendergast's The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise 1957\u20131983. The Larsen family's Time stock was worth around $80\u00a0million during the 1960s, and Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc. director and the chairman of its executive committee, later serving as Time's vice chairman of the board until the middle of 1979. On September 10, 1979, The New York Times wrote, \"Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65.\"After Time magazine began publishing its weekly issues in March 1923, Roy Larsen was able to increase its circulation by using U.S. radio and movie theaters around the world. It often promoted both Time magazine and U.S. political and corporate interests. According to The March of Time, as early as 1924, Larsen had brought Time into the infant radio business with the broadcast of a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled Pop Question which survived until 1925\". Then in 1928, Larsen \"undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries, drawn from current issues of Time magazine\u00a0... which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States\".[citation needed]Larsen next arranged for the 30-minute radio program The March of Time to be broadcast over CBS beginning on March 6, 1931. Each week, the program presented a dramatization of the week's news for its listeners; thus Time magazine itself was brought \"to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence\", according to Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923\u20131941, leading to an increased circulation of the magazine during the 1930s. Between 1931 and 1937, Larsen's The March of Time radio program was broadcast over CBS radio, and between 1937 and 1945, it was broadcast over NBC radio\u00a0\u2013 except between 1939 and 1941, when it was not aired. People magazine was based on Time's \"People\" page.In 1987, Jason McManus succeeded Henry Grunwald as editor-in-chief,[7] and oversaw the transition before Norman Pearlstine succeeded him in 1995.\nIn 1989, when Time, Inc. and Warner Communications merged, Time became part of Time Warner, along with Warner Bros. In 2000, Time became part of AOL Time Warner, which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.In 2007, Time moved from a Monday subscription/newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays, and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday. The magazine actually began in 1923 with Friday publication.In early 2007, the year's first issue was delayed for roughly a week due to \"editorial changes\", including the layoff of 49 employees.[8]In 2009, Time announced that they were introducing Mine, a personalized print magazine mixing content from a range of Time Warner publications based on the reader's preferences. The new magazine was met with a poor reception, with criticism that its focus was too broad to be truly personal.[9]The magazine has an online archive with the unformatted text for every article published. The articles are indexed and were converted from scanned images using optical character recognition technology. The minor errors in the text are remnants of the conversion into digital format.In January 2013, Time Inc. announced that it would cut nearly 500 jobs \u2013 roughly 6% of its 8,000 staff worldwide.[10] Although Time magazine has maintained high sales, its ad pages have declined significantly over time.[11]Also in January 2013, Time Inc. named Martha Nelson as the first female editor-in-chief of its magazine division.[12] In September 2013, Nancy Gibbs was named as the first female managing editor of Time magazine.[12]In November 2017, Meredith Corporation announced its acquisition of Time, Inc., backed by Koch Equity Development.[13] In March 2018, only six weeks after the closure of the sale, Meredith announced that it would explore the sale of Time and sister magazines Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated, since they did not align with the company's lifestyle brands.[14]In 2017, editor and journalist Catherine Mayer, who also founded the Women's Equality Party in the UK, sued Time through attorney Ann Olivarius for sex and age discrimination.[15][16] The suit was resolved in 2018.[17]In September 2018, Meredith Corporation announced that it would re-sell Time to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190\u00a0million, a transaction completed on October 31. Although Benioff is the chairman and co-CEO of Salesforce.com, Time  was to remain separate from that company and Benioff would not be involved in the magazine's daily operations.[18][19] The sale was completed on October 31, 2018. Time USA LLC, the parent company of the magazine, is owned by Marc Benioff.From 1942 until 1979, Time had a Canadian edition that included an insert of five pages of locally produced content as well as occasional Canadian covers. Following changes in the tax status of Canadian editions of American magazines, Time closed Canadian bureaus, except for Ottawa, and published identical content to the US edition but with Canadian advertising.[20] In December 2008, Time discontinued publishing a Canadian advertiser edition.[21]During the second half of 2009, the magazine had a 34.9% decline in newsstand sales.[22] During the first half of 2010, another decline of at least one-third in Time magazine sales occurred. In the second half of 2010, Time magazine newsstand sales declined by about 12% to just over 79,000 copies per week.[citation needed]As of 2012, it had a circulation of 3.3\u00a0million, making it the 11th-most circulated magazine in the United States, and the second-most circulated weekly behind People.[23] As of July 2017, its circulation was 3,028,013.[1] In October 2017, Time cut its circulation to two million.[24] The print edition has a readership of 1.6\u00a0million, 1\u00a0million of whom are based in the United States.Time initially possessed a distinctively \"acerbic, irreverent style\", largely created by Haddon and sometimes called \"Timestyle\".[25] Timestyle made regular use of inverted sentences, as famously parodied in 1936 by Wolcott Gibbs in The New Yorker: \"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind\u00a0... Where it all will end, knows God!\"[26] Time also coined or popularized many neologisms like \"socialite\", \"guesstimate\", \"televangelist\", \"pundit\", and \"tycoon\",[25] as well as some less successful ones like \"cinemactress\" and \"radiorator\".[27] Time introduced the name \"World War II\" in 1939.[28] The false title construction was popularized by Time and indeed is sometimes called a \"Time-style adjective\".[29][30][31][32]Since its first issue, Time has had a \"Milestones\" section about significant events in the lives of famous people, including births, marriages, divorces, and deaths.[33][34] Until 1967, entries in Milestones were short and formulaic. A typical example from 1956:[35]Died. Lieut, (j.g.) David Greig (\"Skippy\") Browning Jr., 24, star of the 1952 Olympics as the U.S.'s dazzling three-meter diving champion, national collegiate one-and three-meter diving champ (1951-52); in the crash of a North American FJ-3 Fury jet fighter while on a training flight; near Rantoul, Kans.A reader wrote a parody of the older form to announce the change:[36]Died. Time's delightful but confusing habit of listing names, ages, claims to fame and other interesting tidbits about the famous newly deceased in its Milestones notices; then the circumstances of, and places where, the deaths occurred; of apparent good sentence structure; in New York.Until the mid-1970s, Time had a weekly \"Listings\" section with capsule summaries or reviews of current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers similar to The New Yorker's \"Current Events\" section.[37]Time is also known for the red border on its cover, introduced in 1927.[38] The border has only been changed seven times since 1927:Former president Richard Nixon has been among the most frequently-featured on the cover of Time, having appeared 55 times from August 25, 1952, to May 2, 1994.[42]In October 2020, the magazine replaced its logo with the word \"Vote\",[43] explaining that \"Few events will shape the world to come more than the result of the upcoming US presidential election\".[44]In 2007, Time redesigned the magazine in order to update and modernize the format.[45] Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased white space around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers. The changes were met with both criticism and praise.[46][47][48]Time's most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual \"Person of the Year\" (formerly \"Man of the Year\") cover story, in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the past 12 months. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, \"for good or ill\", has most affected the course of the year; it is, therefore, not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin have been Man of the Year.In 2006, Person of the Year was \"You\", and was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. Editors Pepper and Timmer reflected that, if it had been a mistake, \"we're only going to make it once\".[49]In 2017, Time named the \"Silence Breakers\", people who came forward with personal stories of sexual harassment, as Person of the Year.[50]In recent years, Time has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Originally, they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list. In some cases, over 100 people have been included, as when two people have made the list together, sharing one spot.The magazine also compiled \"All-Time 100 best novels\" and \"All-Time 100 Movies\" lists in 2005,[51][52][53] \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\" in 2007,[54] and \"All-Time 100 Fashion Icons\" in 2012.[55]In February 2016, Time mistakenly included the male author Evelyn Waugh on its \"100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes\" list (he was 97th on the list). The error created much media attention and concerns about the level of basic education among the magazine's staff.[56] Time later issued a retraction.[56]  In a BBC interview with Justin Webb, Professor Valentine Cunningham of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, described the mistake as \"a piece of profound ignorance on the part of Time magazine\".[57]During its history, on six occasions, Time has released a special issue with a cover showing an X scrawled over the face of a man or a national symbol. The first Time magazine with a red X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over Adolf Hitler's face. The second X cover was released more than three months later on August 20, 1945, with a black X (to date, the magazine's only such use of a black X) covering the flag of Japan, representing the recent surrender of Japan and which signaled the end of World War II. Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, Time released another issue with a red X over Saddam Hussein's face, two weeks after the start of the Invasion of Iraq. On June 13, 2006, Time printed a red X cover issue following the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq. The second most recent red X cover issue of Time was published on May 2, 2011, after the death of Osama bin Laden.[58] As of 2022[update], the most recent red X cover issue of Time features a red X scrawled over the year 2020 and the declaration \"the worst year ever\".[59][60]The November 2, 2020, issue of the U.S. edition of the magazine was the first time that the cover logo \"TIME\" was not used. The cover of that issue used the word \"VOTE\" as a replacement logo, along with artwork by Shepard Fairey of a voter wearing a pandemic face mask, accompanied by information on how to vote. The magazine's editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal explained this decision for a one-time cover logo change as a \"rare moment, one that will separate history into before and after for generations\".[61]Time for Kids is a division magazine of Time that is especially published for children and is mainly distributed in classrooms. TFK contains some national news, a \"Cartoon of the Week\", and a variety of articles concerning popular culture. An annual issue concerning the environment is distributed near the end of the U.S. school term. The publication rarely exceeds ten pages front and back.Time LightBox is a photography blog created and curated by the magazine's photo department that was launched in 2011.[62] In 2011, Life picked LightBox for its Photo Blog Awards.[63]Richard Stengel was the managing editor from May 2006 to October 2013, when he joined the U.S. State Department.[64][65] Nancy Gibbs was the managing editor from September 2013 until September 2017.[65] She was succeeded by Edward Felsenthal, who had been Time's digital editor.[66]In 1940, William Saroyan lists the full Time editorial department in the play, Love's Old Sweet Song.[69]This 1940 snapshot includes:Other major American news magazines:",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Billboard_(magazine)": "Billboard is an American music and entertainment magazine published weekly by the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a division of MRC Media & Info. The magazine provides music charts, news, video, opinion, reviews, events, and style related to the music industry. Its music charts include the Hot 100, the 200, and the Global 200, tracking the most popular albums and songs in different genres of music. It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm, and operates several TV shows.Billboard was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan as a trade publication for bill posters. Donaldson later acquired Hennegan's interest in 1900 for $500. In the early years of the 20th century, it covered the entertainment industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows, and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.The first issue of Billboard was published in Cincinnati, Ohio, by William Donaldson and James Hennegan on November 1, 1894.[2][3] Initially, it covered the advertising and bill posting industry, and was known as Billboard Advertising.[4][5][a] At the time, billboards, posters, and paper advertisements placed in public spaces were the primary means of advertising.[5] Donaldson handled editorial and advertising, while Hennegan, who owned Hennegan Printing Co., managed magazine production. The first issues were just eight pages long.[6] The paper had columns like \"The Bill Room Gossip\" and \"The Indefatigable and Tireless Industry of the Bill Poster\".[2] A department for agricultural fairs was established in 1896.[7] The title was changed to The Billboard in 1897.[8]After a brief departure over editorial differences, Donaldson purchased Hennegan's interest in the business in 1900 for $500 (equal to $13,100 today) to save it from bankruptcy.[6][9] On May 5, Donaldson changed it from a monthly to a weekly paper with  a greater emphasis on breaking news. He improved editorial quality and opened new offices in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, London, and Paris,[8][9] and also re-focused the magazine on outdoor entertainment such as fairs, carnivals, circuses, vaudeville, and burlesque shows.[2][8] A section devoted to circuses was introduced in 1900, followed by more prominent coverage of outdoor events in 1901.[7] Billboard also covered topics including regulation, a lack of professionalism, economics, and new shows. It had a \"stage gossip\" column covering the private lives of entertainers, a \"tent show\" section covering traveling shows, and a sub-section called \"Freaks to order\".[2] According to The Seattle Times, Donaldson also published news articles \"attacking censorship, praising productions exhibiting 'good taste' and fighting yellow journalism\".[10]As railroads became more developed, Billboard set up a mail forwarding system for traveling entertainers. The location of an entertainer was tracked in the paper's Routes Ahead column, then Billboard would receive mail on the star's behalf  and publish a notice in its \"Letter-Box\" column that it has mail for them.[2] This service was first introduced in 1904, and became one of Billboard's largest sources of profit[10] and celebrity connections.[2] By 1914, there were 42,000 people using the service.[6] It was also used as the official address of traveling entertainers for draft letters during World War I.[11] In the 1960s, when it was discontinued, Billboard was still processing 1,500 letters per week.[10]In 1920, Donaldson made a controversial move by hiring African-American journalist James Albert Jackson to write a weekly column devoted to African-American performers.[2] According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers.[2] Jackson was the first black critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race.[10] Donaldson died in 1925.[2]Billboard's editorial changed focus as technology in recording and playback developed, covering \"marvels of modern technology\" such as the phonograph and wireless radios.[2] It began covering coin-operated entertainment machines in 1899, and created a dedicated section for them called \"Amusement Machines\" in March 1932.[9] Billboard began covering the motion picture industry in 1907,[7] but ended up focusing on music due to competition from Variety.[12] It created a radio broadcasting station in the 1920s.[8]The jukebox industry continued to grow through the Great Depression, and was advertised heavily in Billboard,[8]:\u200a262\u200a which led to even more editorial focus on music.[8] The proliferation of the phonograph and radio also contributed to its growing music emphasis.[8] Billboard published the first music hit parade on January 4, 1936,[13] and introduced a \"Record Buying Guide\" in January 1939.[9] In 1940, it introduced \"Chart Line\", which tracked the best-selling records, and was followed by a chart for jukebox records in 1944 called Music Box Machine charts.[8][9] By the 1940s, Billboard was more of a music industry specialist publication.[4] The number of charts it published grew after World War II, due to a growing variety of music interests and genres. It had eight charts by 1987, covering different genres and formats,[9] and 28 charts by 1994.[10]By 1943, Billboard had about 100 employees.[7] The magazine's offices moved to Brighton, Ohio, in 1946, then to New York City in 1948.[10] A five-column tabloid format was adopted in November 1950 and coated paper was first used in Billboard's print issues in January 1963, allowing for photojournalism.[9] Billboard Publications Inc. acquired a monthly trade magazine for candy and cigarette machine vendors called Vend, and, in the 1950s, acquired an advertising trade publication called Tide.[8] By 1969, Billboard Publications Inc. owned eleven trade and consumer publications, a publisher called Watson-Guptill Publications, a set of self-study cassette tapes, and four television franchises. It also acquired Photo Weekly that year.[8]Over time, subjects that Billboard still covered outside of music were spun-off into separate publications: Funspot magazine was created in 1957 to cover amusement parks, and Amusement Business was created in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment. In January 1961, Billboard was renamed as Billboard Music Week[5][8] to emphasize its new exclusive interest in music.[12] Two years later, it was renamed to just Billboard.[8][9] According to The New Business Journalism, by 1984, Billboard Publications was a \"prosperous\" conglomerate of trade magazines, and Billboard had become the \"undisputed leader\" in music industry news.[4] In the early 1990s, Billboard introduced Billboard Airplay Monitors, a publication for disc jockeys and music programmers.[5] By the end of the 1990s, Billboard dubbed itself the \"bible\" of the recording industry.[5]Billboard struggled after its founder William Donaldson died in 1925, and, within three years, was once again heading towards bankruptcy.[8] Donaldson's son-in-law Roger Littleford took over in 1928 and \"nursed the publication back to health\".[8][11] His sons Bill and Roger became co-publishers in 1946[11] and inherited the publication in the late 1970s after Roger Littleford's death.[8] They sold it to private investors in 1985 for an estimated $40\u00a0million.[14] The investors cut costs and acquired a trade publication for the Broadway theatre industry called Backstage.[8]In 1987, Billboard was sold again to Affiliated Publications for $100\u00a0million.[14] Billboard Publications Inc. became a subsidiary of Affiliated Publications called BPI Communications.[8] As BPI Communications, it acquired The Hollywood Reporter, Adweek, Marketing Week, and Mediaweek, and also purchased Broadcast Data Systems, a high-tech firm for tracking music airtime.[8] Private investors from Boston Ventures and BPI executives re-purchased a two-thirds interest in Billboard Publications for $100\u00a0million, and more acquisitions followed. In 1993, it created a division known as Billboard Music Group for music-related publications.[8]In 1994, Billboard Publications was sold to Dutch media conglomerate Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU) for $220\u00a0million.[15][b] VNU acquired the Clio Awards in advertising and the National Research Group in 1997, as well as Editor & Publisher in 1999. In July 2000, it paid $650\u00a0million for the publisher Miller Freeman. BPI was combined with other entities in VNU in 2000 to form Bill Communications Inc. By the time CEO Gerald Hobbs retired in 2003, VNU had grown substantially larger, but had a large amount of debt from the acquisitions. An attempted $7\u00a0billion acquisition of IMS Health in 2005 prompted protests from shareholders that halted the deal; it eventually agreed to an $11\u00a0billion takeover bid from investors in 2006.[8]VNU then changed its name to Nielsen in 2007, the namesake of a company it acquired for $2.5\u00a0billion in 1999.[17][18] New CEO Robert Krakoff divested some of the previously owned publications, restructured the organization, and planned some acquisitions before dying suddenly in 2007; he was subsequently replaced by Greg Farrar.[8]Nielsen owned Billboard until 2009, when it was one of eight publications sold to e5 Global Media Holdings. e5 was formed by investment firms Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners for the purpose of the acquisition.[19][20] The following year, the new parent company was renamed as Prometheus Global Media.[21] Three years later, Guggenheim Partners acquired Pluribus' share of Prometheus and became the sole owner of Billboard.[22][23]In December 2015, Guggenheim Digital Media spun out several media brands, including Billboard, to its own executive Todd Boehly.[24][25] The assets operate under the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, a unit of the holding company Eldridge Industries.[26]Timothy White was appointed editor-in-chief in 1991, a position he held until his unexpected death in 2002. White wrote a weekly column promoting music with \"artistic merit\", while criticizing music with violent or misogynistic themes,[27] and also reworked the publication's music charts.[27] Rather than relying on data from music retailers, new charts used data from store checkout scanners obtained from Nielsen SoundScan.[8] White also wrote in-depth profiles on musicians,[28] but was replaced by Keith Girard, who was subsequently fired in May 2004. He and a female employee filed a $29\u00a0million lawsuit alleging that Billboard fired them unfairly with an intent to damage their reputations.[29] The lawsuit claimed that they experienced sexual harassment, a hostile work environment, and a financially motivated lack of editorial integrity.[29][30] Email evidence suggested that human resources were given special instructions to watch minority employees.[30] The case was settled out-of-court in 2006 for a non-disclosed sum.[31]In the 2000s, economic decline in the music industry dramatically reduced readership and advertising from Billboard's traditional audience.[29][32] Circulation declined from 40,000 in circulation in the 1990s to less than 17,000 by 2014.[31] The publication's staff and ownership were also undergoing frequent changes.[30]In 2004, Tamara Conniff became the first female and youngest-ever executive editor at Billboard, and led its first major redesign since the 1960s, by Daniel Stark and Stark Design. During her tenure, Billboard newsstand sales jumped 10%, ad pages climbed 22%, and conference registrations rose 76%.[33] In 2005, Billboard expanded its editorial outside the music industry into other areas of digital and mobile entertainment. In 2006, after leading Billboard's radio publication, former ABC News and CNN journalist, Scott McKenzie, was named editorial director across all Billboard properties.[34] Conniff launched the Billboard Women in Music event in 2007.[35][36][37][38]Bill Werde was named editorial director in 2008,[39] and was followed by Janice Min in January 2014, also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter.[39] The magazine has since been making changes to make it more of a general interest music news source as opposed to solely an industry trade, branching out into covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip.[31][32][40] Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was unusual, in that he did not have a background in the music industry.[40] Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014.[41] An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboard's annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit that singer Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.[31]Gervino was let go in May 2016. A note from Min to the editorial staff indicated that Senior Vice President of Digital Content Mike Bruno would serve as the head of editorial moving forward.[42]\nOn June 15, 2016, BillboardPH, the first Billboard chart company in Southeast Asia, mainly in the Philippines, was announced.[43] On September 12, 2016, Billboard expanded into China by launching Billboard China in a partnership with Vision Music Ltd.[44]On September 23, 2020, it was announced that Penske Media Corporation would assume operations of the MRC Media & Info publications under a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC. The joint venture includes management of Billboard.[45]Billboard publishes a news website and weekly trade magazine that cover music, video and home entertainment. Most of the articles are written by staff writers, while some are written by industry experts.[9] It covers news, gossip, opinion,[2] and music reviews, but its \"most enduring and influential creation\" is the Billboard charts.[5] The charts track music sales, radio airtime and other data about the most popular songs and albums.[5] The Billboard Hot 100 chart of the top-selling songs was introduced in 1958. Since then, the Billboard 200, which tracks the top-selling albums, has become more popular as an indicator of commercial success.[2] Billboard has also published books in collaboration with Watson-Guptill and a radio and television series called American Top 40, based on Billboard charts.[9] A daily Billboard Bulletin was introduced in February 1997[5] and Billboard hosts about 20 industry events each year.[1]Billboard is considered one of the most reputable sources of music industry news.[10][32] The website includes the Billboard Charts, news separated by music genre, videos, and a separate website. It also compiles lists, hosts a fashion website called Pret-a-Reporter, and publishes eight different newsletters.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Temecula,_California": "Temecula (/t\u0259\u02c8m\u025bkj\u028al\u0259/; Spanish: Tem\u00e9cula, [te'mekula]; Luise\u00f1o: Temeekunga) is a city in southwestern Riverside County, California, United States. The city is a tourist and resort destination, with the Temecula Valley Wine Country, Old Town Temecula, the Temecula Valley Balloon & Wine Festival, the Temecula Valley International Film Festival, championship golf courses, and resort accommodations for tourists which contribute to the city's economic profile.[8][9][10][11] Although Temecula is geographically closer to downtown San Diego than downtown Los Angeles, it is considered part of the Greater Los Angeles area.The city of Temecula, forming the southwestern anchor of the Inland Empire region, is approximately 58 miles (93\u00a0km) north of downtown San Diego and 85 miles (137\u00a0km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Temecula is bordered by the city of Murrieta to the north and the Pechanga Indian Reservation and San Diego County to the south. With a population of 110,003 during the 2020 census, Temecula is the 5th most populous city in Riverside County.[6] It was incorporated on December 1, 1989.The area was inhabited by the Temecula Indians for hundreds of years before their contact with the Spanish missionaries (the people are now generally known as the Luise\u00f1os, after the nearby Mission San Luis Rey de Francia).[12] Seven bands of Luise\u00f1o Indians inhabited the Temecula valley pre-contact. They were made up of the Pechanga, La Jolla, Soboba, Pala, Rincon, Pauma, and San Luis Rey bands (presently, all of the bands except the San Luis Rey are federally recognized tribes).[13][14] The Pechanga Band of Luise\u00f1o believe their ancestors have lived in the Temecula area for more than 10,000 years, though ethnologists think they arrived at a more recent date. In Pechanga history, life on Earth began in the Temecula Valley. They call it \"'\u00c9xva Teme\u00e9ku\", the place of the union of Sky-father, and Earth-mother (\"Tuukumit'pi Tamaayowit\").[13] The Temecula Indians (\"Temeekuyam\") lived at \"Temeekunga\", or \"the place of the sun\".[15] Other popular interpretations of the name include \"The sun that shines through the mist\"[16] or \"Where the sun breaks through the mist\".[17]The first recorded Spanish visit occurred in October 1797, with a Franciscan padre, Father Juan Norberto de Santiago, and Captain Pedro Lisalde.[17][18] Father Santiago kept a journal in which he noted seeing \"Temecula ... an Indian village\".[19] The trip included the Lake Elsinore area and the Temecula Valley.Little is known about the early 1800s because Temecula records were destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[20]In 1798, Spanish missionaries established the Mission of San Luis Rey de Francia and designated the Indians living in the region as \"Sanluise\u00f1os\", shortened to \"Luise\u00f1os\".[21] In the 1820s, the nearby Mission San Antonio de Pala was built.The Mexican land grants made in the Temecula area were Rancho Temecula, granted to Felix Valdez, and to the east Rancho Pauba, granted to Vicente Moraga in 1844. Rancho Little Temecula was made in 1845 to Luise\u00f1o Pablo Apis, one of the few former mission converts to be given a land grant. It was fertile well watered land at the southern end of the valley, which included the village of Temecula.[22][23][24][25] A fourth grant, known as Rancho Santa Rosa, was made to Juan Moreno in 1846, and was in the hills to the west of Temecula.On December 6, 1846, at the Battle of San Pasqual, Andr\u00e9s Pico led Californios to kill over twenty of U.S. General Stephen W. Kearny's men. Subsequently, in January 1847, Jos\u00e9 Lugo with Cahuilla Indians came to the Temecula Valley in pursuit of the Luise\u00f1o Indians and killed an unknown number, about 40-100 of them, reportedly, in the canyon just west of the current Vail Lake Dam.[26]As American settlers moved into the area after the war, conflict with the native tribes increased. A treaty was signed in the Magee Store in Temecula in 1852, but was never ratified by the United States Senate.[27] In addition, the Luise\u00f1os challenged the Mexican land grant claims, as, under Mexican law, the land was held in trust to be distributed to the local Indian tribes after becoming subjects.[28][29] They challenged the Apis claim to the Little Temecula Rancho by taking the case to the 1851 California Land Commission. On November 15, 1853, the commission rejected the Luise\u00f1o claim; an appeal in 1856 to the district court was found to be in favor of the heirs of Pablo Apis (he had died in late 1853 or early 1854). The Luise\u00f1o of Temecula village remained on the south side of Temecula Creek when the Apis grant was acquired by Louis Wolf in 1872; they were evicted in 1875.[30]A stagecoach line started a local route from Warner Ranch to Colton in 1857 that passed through the Temecula Valley. Within a year, the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line, with a route between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, stopped at Temecula's Magee Store.[31] On April 22, 1859, the first inland Southern California post office was established in Temecula in the Magee Store. This was the second post office in the state, the first being located in San Francisco. The Temecula post office was moved in the ensuing years; its present locations are the seventh and eighth sites occupied. The American Civil War put an end to the Butterfield Overland Stage Service, but stage service continued on the route under other stage companies until the railroad reached Fort Yuma in 1877.[32]In 1862, Louis Wolf, a Temecula merchant and postmaster, married Ramona Place, who was mixed-race and half Indian. Author Helen Hunt Jackson spent time with Louis and Ramona Wolf in 1882 and again in 1883. Wolf's store became an inspiration for Jackson's fictional \"Hartsel's store\" in her 1884 novel, Ramona.[33]In 1882, the United States government established the Pechanga Indian Reservation of approximately 4,000 acres (16\u00a0km2) some 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) from downtown Temecula. Also in 1882, the California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railroad completed construction of the section from National City to Temecula. In 1883, the line was extended to San Bernardino. In the late 1880s, a series of floods washed out the tracks and the section of the railroad through the canyon was finally abandoned. The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.In the 1890s, with the operation of granite stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curbstones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.In 1904, Walter L. Vail, who had come to the United States with his parents from Nova Scotia, migrated to California. Along with various partners, he began buying land in Southern California. Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying 38,000 acres (154\u00a0km2) of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a streetcar in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.By 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over 87,500 acres (354\u00a0km2). In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the Temecula Creek water and created Vail Lake. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures.In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the Kaiser\u2014Aetna partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to 97,500 acres (395\u00a0km2), and the area became known as Rancho California.In 1970, the Temecula Town Association, a non-profit, charitable organization, incorporated.[34]In the 1970 census, the United States Census Bureau enumerated the population of the entire Murrieta-Rancho California-Temecula area at 2,769. In the 1980 census, 10,215 people were enumerated, a 269 percent increase.[35]On November 5, 1979, KRTM 88.9 FM went on the air in Temecula.[36]In 1985, the completion of Interstate 15 between the Greater Los Angeles area and San Diego began a subdivision land boom, making it possible to own a new home in Temecula and have a manageable work commute to San Diego County.[35]On December 1, 1989, Temecula incorporated as a city. In 1990, the first United States Census Bureau count of Temecula as a city enumerated 27,099 people.[35]The 1990s brought rapid growth to the Temecula Valley. Many families began moving to the area from San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County, drawn by the affordable housing prices and the popular wine country.From 1993 to 1998, Zev Buffman, and later with Dusty Rogers, son of Roy Rogers, promoted an historic district entertainment venue project renamed RogersDale U.S.A..[35]In 1995, the Pechanga Pow Wow began.[37][38][39]On October 27, 1999, the Promenade Mall opened in Temecula.[40]In 2005, Temecula annexed the master-planned community of Redhawk, bringing the population to 90,000. After a period of rapid population growth and home construction, the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis and the resultant United States housing market correction caused a sharp rise in home foreclosures in the Temecula-Murrieta region.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 37.28 square miles (96.6\u00a0km2), of which 37.27 square miles (96.5\u00a0km2) of it is land and 0.012 square miles (0.031\u00a0km2) of it (0.03%) is water. South of the city, Murrieta Creek and Temecula Creek join to form the Santa Margarita River.Temecula has a warm Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen:Csa).[41] August is typically the hottest month of the year with December being the coldest month. Most precipitation occurs from November to March with February being the wettest month. Winter storms generally bring moderate precipitation, but strong winter storms are not uncommon especially during \"El Ni\u00f1o\" years. The driest month is June. Annual precipitation is 14.14 inches (359\u00a0mm). Morning marine layer is common during May and June. From July to September, Temecula experiences hot, dry weather with the occasional North American monsoonal flow that increases the humidity and brings isolated thunderstorms. Most of the storms tend to be short-lived with little rainfall. During late fall into winter, Temecula experiences dry, windy northeastern Santa Ana winds. Snowfall is rare, but Temecula has experienced traces of snowfall on occasion,[42] some as recently as December 2014.[43] A rare F1 tornado touched down in a Temecula neighborhood on February 19, 2005.[44]As of the 2020 United States census, Temecula had a population of 110,003.

Temecula is also located within 60 miles (97\u00a0km) of both the Ontario International Airport and the San Diego International Airport.[99]The Temecula Cemetery is operated by the Temecula Public Cemetery District.[100] Land for the cemetery was originally donated by Mercedes Pujol in 1884 from the estate of her husband, Domingo Pujol.[101]Temecula is home to Temecula Valley Hospital, a five-story, 140-bed hospital that opened in October 2013.[102][103] Temecula Valley Hospital is a member of Universal Health Services.[104]Kaiser Permanente and UC San Diego Health both offer services in Temecula.[105][106]Temecula provides police service in cooperation with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department via a contract with the department fulfilled through its Southwest Sheriff's Station, located in the unincorporated community of French Valley, just north of the city of Temecula, east of State Route 79 (Winchester Road). The station is adjacent to the Riverside County Superior Court's Southwest Regional Judicial District Courthouse and Southwest Detention Center, one of the five regional jails in Riverside County. The sheriff's station is currently commanded by Captain Lisa McConnell,[107] who also serves as Temecula's Chief of Police.The city of Temecula contracts for fire and paramedic services with the Riverside County Fire Department through a cooperative agreement with CAL FIRE. Temecula currently has five fire stations with five paramedic engine companies, one truck company and two CAL FIRE wildland fire engines.[108]American Medical Response provides paramedic ambulance transport to an emergency department.Temecula maintains international relations with Daisen, Tottori in Japan. Until 2019, the city also maintained international relations with Leidschendam-Voorburg in the Netherlands.[121]The city dedicated a Japanese Garden at the Temecula Duck Pond to honor the 10th anniversary of their relationship with sister city Daisen.The Temecula Duck Pond is also home to an art piece entitled \"Singing in the Rain\". It was commissioned by the city of Leidschendam-Voorburg as a gift to the city to commemorate the resilient American spirit in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The piece depicts a mother and her children bravely pedaling a bicycle into the strong headwinds of a storm.[122]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Multiracial_people": "Multiracial people are people of more than one race or ethnicity.[1] A variety of terms have been used for multi-racial people, including mixed-race, biracial, multiethnic, polyethnic, occasionally bi-ethnic, M\u00e9tis, Creole,[2] Muwallad,[3] Colored, Dougla, half-caste, mestizo,[4] Melungeon,[5] quadroon,[6] octoroon, sambo/zambo,[7] Eurasian,[8] hapa, h\u0101fu, Garifuna, pardo and Guran.Individuals of multiracial backgrounds make up a significant portion of the population in many parts of the world. In North America, studies have found that the multiracial population is continuing to grow. In many countries of Latin America, mestizos make up the majority of the population. In the Caribbean, multiracial people officially make up the majority of the population in both the Dominican Republic (73%), Aruba (68%), and Cuba (51%).[9]While defining race is controversial,[10] race remains a commonly used term for classification, often related to visible physical characteristics or known community. In so far as race is defined differently in different cultures, perceptions of multiraciality are subjective.According to U.S. sociologist Troy Duster and ethicist Pilar Ossorio:Some percentage of people who look white will possess genetic markers indicating that a significant majority of their recent ancestors were African. Some percentage of people who look black will possess genetic markers indicating the majority of their recent ancestors were European.[11]In the United States:Many state and local agencies comply with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 1997 revised standards for the collection, tabulation, and presentation of federal data on race and ethnicity. The revised OMB standards identify a minimum of five racial categories: White; Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Perhaps the most significant change for Census 2000 was that respondents were given the option to mark one or more races on the questionnaire to indicate their racial identity. Census 2000 race data are shown for people who reported a race either alone or in combination with one or more other races.[12]In the English-speaking world, many terms for multiracial people exist, some of which are pejorative or are no longer used. Mulato, zambo and mestizo are used in Spanish, mulato, caboclo, cafuzo, ainoko (from Japanese) and mesti\u00e7o in Portuguese, and mul\u00e2tre and m\u00e9tis in French. These terms are also in certain contexts used in the English-speaking world. In Canada, the M\u00e9tis are a recognized ethnic group of mixed European and Indigenous American descent, who have status in the law similar to that of First Nations .Terms such as mulatto for people of partially African descent and mestizo for people of partially Native American descent are still used by English-speaking people of the Western Hemisphere[citation needed] but mostly to refer to the past or to the demography of Latin America and its diasporic population. Half-breed is a historic term that referred to people of partial Native American ancestry; it is now considered pejorative and discouraged from use. Mestee, once widely used, is now used mostly for members of historically mixed-race groups, such as Louisiana Creoles, Melungeons, Redbones, Brass Ankles and Mayles.In South Africa and much of English-speaking southern Africa, the term Coloured was used to describe both mixed-race persons of African and European descent, and those Asians not of African descent.[13] While the term is socially accepted, it is becoming outdated because of its association with the apartheid era.[citation needed]In Latin America, populations became triracial after the introduction of African slavery. A panoply of terms developed during the Spanish and Portuguese colonial periods, including terms such as zambo for persons of Amerindian and African descent. Charts and diagrams intended to explain the classifications were common. The well-known Casta paintings in Mexico and, to some extent, Peru, were illustrations of the different classifications.At one time, Latin American census categories have used such classifications. In Brazilian censuses since the Imperial times, for example, most persons of multiracial heritage, except Asian Brazilians with some European descent (or any other to the extent it is not clearly perceptible) and vice versa, tend to be thrown into the single category of \"pardo\". But racial boundaries in Brazil are related less to ancestry than to phenotype. A westernized Amerindian with copper-colored skin may also be classified as a \"pardo\", a caboclo in this case, despite not being multiracial. A European-looking person, even with one or more African or Indigenous ancestors, is not classified as \"pardo\" but as \"branco\", a white Brazilian. The same applies to \"negros\", Afro-Brazilians whose European or Amerindian ancestors are not visible in their appearance. According to genetic research, most Brazilians of all racial groups (except Asian-Brazilians and natives) are, to some extent, mixed-race.In English, the terms miscegenation and amalgamation were used for unions between whites, blacks, and other ethnic groups. Those terms are now often considered offensive and are becoming obsolete.[citation needed] The terms mixed-race, biracial or multiracial are becoming generally accepted. In other languages, terms for miscegenation are not necessarily considered offensive.[14]In East Africa, specifically Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (including portions of the East African Community), people of mixed raced are called Half-castes (in English) or chotara (singular, in Swahili), wachotara (plural in Swahili).[15]In North Africa, numerous multiracial communities can be found, reflecting a history of both extensive Mediterranean trade around the region and later colonization and migration by African groups. Among these are the Haratin, oasis-dwellers of Saharan southern Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. They are believed to be an ethnicity composed of Sub-Saharan Africans and Berber ancestry. They constitute a socially and ethnically distinct group.[16]For centuries Arab slave traders sold sub-Saharan Africans as slaves in cumulatively large numbers throughout the Persian Gulf, Anatolia, Central Asia and the Arab world. Communities descended from these slaves and local peoples can be found throughout these regions.[17] Barbary pirates were known to attack European and British ships and take Europeans into slavery as well. So many were taken, that the memoirs of survivors are considered a literary genre known as captivity narratives. When English and other European colonists were taken captive by Native Americans, they had models for recounting their trials.According to a recent genetic study in 2019, North African populations are composed of admixture of extensive gene flow from four different geographical regions (North Africa  (Iberomaurusian), Europe, West Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa) and temporal sources (Palaeolithic migrations, Neolithization, Arabization, and recent migrations).[18]Almost the entire population of Madagascar is an about equal admixture of South East Asian (Indonesian), primarily from Borneo, and Bantu-speaking settlers primarily from the mainland at Mozambique.[19] Years of intermarriages created the Malagasy people, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu influences.[19]In South Africa, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between Whites (people of European descent) and non-Whites (being classified as Black, Asian and Coloured). But this followed centuries of interaction and unions resulting in multiracial children, especially among whites, Africans (black), and coloured. This law was repealed in 1985.Multiracial South Africans are commonly referred to as Coloureds. According to the 2016 South African Census,[20] they are the second-largest ethnic group (8.8%), behind Black Africans, or Bantu peoples, who constitute (80.8%) of the current population. White South Africans make up 8.1%.[20]Today, many Central Asian populations are an amalgamation of various peoples such as Mongols, Turkics, and Iranians. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia in 13th century resulted in the massacre of the population of Iranians and other Indo-European peoples, as well as a large degree of unions and assimilation. Genetic studies shows that Central Asian Turkic people and Hazara are a mixture of Northeast Asians and Indo-European people. Caucasian ancestry is prevalent in almost all central Asian Turkic people. Kazakhs, Hazara, Karakalpaks, Crimean Tatars have more European MtDNA than European Y-DNA. Kyrgyz have mostly European Y-DNA, with substantial European MtDNA. Other Turkic people, such as Uyghurs and Uzbeks, have mostly European Y-DNA but also a significantly higher percentage of European MtDNA. Turkmen have predominantly European DNA in both paternal and maternal lines.[21]Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a radical thinker and educator, was of Indian and European background.[relevance questioned]\nPrior to colonization, the peoples of India had a long history of trade and other interaction with other peoples. More recently a Eurasian mix developed during the Colonial period, beginning with the French, Dutch, Portuguese and other European traders and merchants, including British. Such interaction continued during the British Rule in India, although it lessened as British families settled in the country. The estimated population of Anglo-Indians, the term for these Eurasians, is 600,000 worldwide, with the majority living in India and the UK.Article 366(2) of the Indian Constitution defines Anglo-Indian as:[22][23](2) an Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only;Goans are an assimilation of Indo-Aryan, Eurasian, and Luso-Asian ancestries. Many have Portuguese ancestors, as they had considerable influence in Goa for over 450 years. Many Goans have traced family trees to find Portuguese ancestors from hundreds of years ago. Some Goans today identify as Portuguese-Goan as they have much Portuguese ancestry and Portuguese surnames.[citation needed]Myanmar (formerly Burma) was a British colony from 1826 until 1948. Other European nationals were active in the country before the British arrived. Intermarriage and relationships took place among such settlers and merchants with the local Burmese population, and subsequently between British colonists and the Burmese. The local Eurasian population is known as the Anglo-Burmese. This group dominated colonial society and through the early years of independence. After Burma gained independence in 1948, many Anglo-Burmese left the country; the diaspora resides primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. An estimated 52,000 Anglo-Burmese live in Burma.The Philippines was a Spanish colony for almost four centuries, or 333 years. The United States took it over after the Spanish-American War, ruling for 46 years. Many Filipinos are of mixed Spanish Filipino and Philippine-American descent.After the defeat of Spain during the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898, the Philippines and other remaining Spanish colonies were ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. The Philippines was under U.S. sovereignty until 1946, though occupied by Japan during World War II. In 1946, in the Treaty of Manila, the U.S. recognized the Republic of the Philippines as an independent nation. Even after 1946, the U.S. maintained a strong  military presence in the Philippines, with as many as 21 U.S. military bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there as defense in Asia and during the Vietnam War.After the bases closed in 1992, American troops left, often abandoning partners and their Amerasian children.[24] The Pearl S. Buck International foundation estimates there are 52,000 Amerasians in the Philippines, with 5,000 in the Clark area of Angeles City.[25] An academic research paper presented in 2012 in the U.S. by an Angeles, Pampanga, Philippines Amerasian college research study unit suggests that the number could be much higher.[26]In the United States, intermarriage between Filipinos and other ethnicities is common. They have the highest number of interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California.[27] Some 21.8% of Philippine-Americans are of mixed ancestry.[28]According to government statistics, the population of Singapore as of September 2007 was 4.68 million. Multiracial people, including Chindians and Eurasians, formed 2.4%.In Singapore and Malaysia, the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between Chinese and Indians. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as \"Chindian\". The Malaysian government classifies them only by their father's ethnicity. As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as \"Indian\" by the government. As for the Malays, who are predominantly Muslim, legal restrictions in Malaysia make it uncommon for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly Hindu, or the Chinese, who are predominantly Buddhist and Taoist.[29] But Muslims and Arabs in Singapore and Malaysia often take local Malay wives, because of their common Islamic faith.[30]The Chitty people, in Singapore and the Malacca state of Malaysia, are Tamils with considerable Malay ancestry. The early Tamil settlers took local wives, as they had not brought their own women at that time.In the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, intermarriage has been common between Chinese and native tribespeople, such as the Murut and Dusun in Sabah, and the Iban and Bisaya in Sarawak. A mixture of cultures has resulted in both states. The offspring of these marriages are called \"Sino-(name of tribe)\", e.g. Sino-Dusun. Normally, children are strongly affected by the father's ethnicity and culture, being raised in his culture. These Sino-natives usually become fluent in both Malay and English. A smaller number are able to speak Chinese dialects and Mandarin, especially those who have received education in vernacular Chinese schools.Due to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the island of Sri Lanka has been a confluence for settlers from various parts of the world. There are several mixed-race ethnicities in the Island. The most notable mixed-race group are the Sri Lankan Moors, who trace their ancestry to Arab traders who settled on the island and intermarried with local women. Today, the Sri Lankan Moors live primarily in urban communities. They preserve Arab-Islamic cultural heritage while adopting many Southern Asian customs.The Burghers are a Eurasian ethnic group. They are descendants through paternal lines of European colonists from the 16th to 20th centuries (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, German and British) and with maternal ancestry among local women. Other European minorities in such admixtures include Swedish, Norwegian, French and Irish.The Sri Lanka Kaffirs are an ethnic group partially descended from 16th-century Portuguese traders and their enslaved Africans. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, the Sri Lanka Kaffir language, which is now extinct. Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja, as well as the Portuguese Sinhalese, Creole, Afro-Sinhalese varieties.During the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and child prisoners. The Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek, two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding Hambroek persuade them to surrender or else he would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation. In addition to this, a rumor was spreading among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging native Taiwan aboriginals to kill the Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children also being killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine,[31][32][33] and Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives. The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that  \"the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and then sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.\"[34] In 1684 some of these Dutch wives were still captives of the Chinese.[35]Some Dutch physical traits like auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode of Dutch women becoming concubines to the Chinese commanders.[36] The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives who were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be living. In Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners, proposed by a son of Koxinga's, but it came to nothing.[37] The Chinese officers used the Dutch women they received as concubines.[38][39][40] The Dutch women were used for sexual pleasure by Koxinga's commanders.[41] This event of Dutch women being distributed to the Chinese soldiers and commanders was recorded in the daily journal of the fort.[42]A teenage daughter of the Dutch missionary Anthonius Hambroek became a concubine to Koxinga. She was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as \"a very sweet and pleasing maiden\".[43][44]Dutch language accounts record this incident of Chinese taking Dutch women as concubines and the date of Hambroek's daughter.[45][46][47][48]Under terms of the Geneva Accords of 1954, departing French troops took thousands of Vietnamese wives and children with them after the First Indochina War. Some Eurasians stayed in Vietnam, after independence from French rule.[49]Ottoman slave traders sold slaves in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries throughout the Persian Gulf, Anatolia, Central Asia and the Arab world and communities descended from these slaves can be found throughout these regions.[17]In 1991 an analysis of the census showed that 50% of Black/Mixed Caribbean men born in the UK have white partners,[50] and the 2011 BBC documentary Mixed Britannia noted that 1 in 10 British children are growing up in interracial households.In 2000, The Sunday Times reported that \"Britain has the highest rate of interracial relationships in the world\" and certainly the UK has the highest rate in the European Union.[51] The 2001 census showed the population of England to be 1.4% mixed-race, compared with 2.7% in Canada and 1.4% in the U.S. (estimate from 2002), although this U.S. figure did not include mixed-race people who had a black parent. Both the US and UK have fewer people identifying as mixed race, however, than Canada.In the United Kingdom, many multiracial people have Caribbean, African or Asian heritage. For example, supermodel Naomi Campbell, who has Jamaican, African and Asian roots. Some, like 2008 Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, are referred to or describe themselves as 'mixed'.The 2001 UK Census included a section entitled 'Mixed' to which 1.4% (1.6% by 2005 estimates) of people responded, which was split further into White and Black Caribbean, White and Asian, White and Black African and Other Mixed.[citation needed] In the 2011 census, 2.2% chose 'Mixed' for the question on ethnicity.[52]Multiracial Canadians in 2006 officially totaled 1.5% of the population, up from 1.2% in 2001. The official mixed race population grew by 25% since the previous census. Of these, the most frequent combinations were multiple visible minorities (for example, people of mixed black and South Asian heritage form the majority, specifically in Toronto), followed closely by white-black, white-Chinese, white-Arab and many other smaller mixes.[56]During the time of slavery in the United States, a very large but unknown number of African American slaves escaped to Canada, where slavery was made illegal in 1834, via the Underground Railroad. Many of these people married in with European Canadian and Native Canadian populations, although their precise numbers and the numbers of their descendants, are not known.Another 1.2% of Canadians officially are M\u00e9tis (descendants of a historical population who were partially Aboriginal\u2014also called \"Indian\" or \"Native\"\u2014and European, particularly English, Scottish, Irish and French ethnic groups). Although the term \"M\u00e9tis\" stems from the Latin verb misc\u0113re, \"to mix\", the M\u00e9tis people are a distinct ethnic group within Canada.In the United States, the 2000 census was the first in the history of the country to offer respondents the option of identifying themselves as belonging to more than one race. This multiracial option was considered a necessary adaptation to the demographic and cultural changes that the United States has been experiencing.[57]Multiracial Americans officially numbered 6.1 million in 2006, or 2.0% of the population.[58][59] There is considerable evidence that an accurate number would be much higher. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage. The development of binary thinking about race meant that African Americans, a high proportion of whom have also had European ancestry, were classified as black. Some are now reclaiming additional ancestries. Many Americans today are multi-racial without knowing it. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2002, over 75% of all African Americans had multiracial ancestries usually Native American.[60]In 2010, the number of Americans who checked both \"black\" and \"white\" on their census forms was 134 percent higher than it had been a decade earlier.[61] In 2012, those choosing 'Two or more races' on the census was 2.4% of the total.[62]According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white is as follows:The stigma of a mixed race heritage, associated with racial discrimination among numerous racial groups, has decreased significantly in the United States. People of mixed-race heritage can identify themselves now in the U.S. Census by any combination of races, whereas before Americans were required to select from only one category. For example, in 2010, they were offered choices of one or more racial categories from the following list:[64]Many mixed raced Americans use the term biracial. The US has a growing multiracial identity movement, reflective of a desire by people to claim their full identities. Interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks, was historically deemed immoral and illegal in most states in the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century because of  its long association of blacks with the slave caste. California and the Western United States had similar laws to prohibit European-Asian marriages, which was associated with discrimination against Chinese and Japanese on the West Coast. Many states eventually repealed such laws and a 1967 decision by the US Supreme Court (Loving v. Virginia) overturned all remaining US anti-miscegenation laws.The United States is one of the most racially diverse countries in the world. Americans are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities culturally distinct in their former countries. Assimilation and integration took place, unevenly at different periods of history, depending on the American region. The \"Americanization\" of foreign ethnic groups and the inter-racial diversity of millions of Americans has been a fundamental part of its history, especially on frontiers where different groups of people came together.[68]On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was sworn in as America's first multiracial president,[69] as he is the son of a European American mother and a Luo father from Kenya. He acknowledges both parents. His official White House biography describes him as African American.[70] In Hawai'i, the U.S. state in which he was born, he would be called \"hapa\", which is the Hawaiian word for \"mixed ethnic heritage\".[71]Fiji has long been a multi-ethnic country, with a vast majority of people having multi-racial heritages even if they do not self-identify in that manner. The indigenous Fijians are of mixed Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry, resulting from years of migration of islanders from various places mixing with each other. Fiji Islanders from the Lau group have intermarried with Tongans and other Polynesians over the years. The overwhelming majority of the rest of the indigenous Fijians, though, can be genetically traced to having mixed Polynesian/Melanesian ancestry.The Indo-Fijian population is also a hodge-podge of South Asian immigrants (called Girmits in Fiji), who came as indentured labourers beginning in 1879. While a few of these labourers managed to bring wives, many of them either took or were given wives once they arrived in Fiji. The Girmits, who are classified as simply \"Indians\" to this day, came from many parts of the Indian subcontinent of present-day India, Pakistan and to a lesser degree Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is easy to recognize the Indian mixtures present in Fiji and see obvious traces of Southern and Northern Indians and other groups who have been categorised together. To some degree, even more of this phenomenon would have likely happened if the religious groups represented (primarily Hindu, Muslim and Sikh) had not resisted to some degree marriage between religious groups, which tended to be from more similar parts of the Indian subcontinent.Over the years, particularly in the sugar cane-growing regions of Western Viti Levu and parts of Vanua Levu, Indo-Fijians and Indigenous Fijians have mixed. Others have Chinese/Fijian ancestry, Indo-Fijian/Samoan or Rotuman ancestry and European/Fijian ancestry (often called \"part Fijians\"). The latter are often descendants of shipwrecked sailors and settlers who came during the colonial period. Migration from a dozen or more different Pacific countries (Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and Wallis and Futuna being the most prevalent) have added to the various ethnicities and intermarriages.Mestizo is the common word used to describe multiracial people in Latin America, especially people with Native American and Spanish or other European ancestry. Mestizos make up a large portion of Latin Americans, comprising a majority in many countries.In Latin America, racial mixture was officially acknowledged from colonial times. There was official nomenclature for every conceivable mixture present in the various countries. Initially, this classification was used as a type of caste system, where rights and privileges were accorded depending on one's official racial classification. Official caste distinctions were abolished in many countries of the Spanish-speaking Americas as they became independent of Spain. Several terms have remained in common usage.Race and racial mixture have played a significant role in the politics of many Latin American countries. In most countries, for example Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Panama, a majority of the population can be described as biracial or multiracial (depending on the country). In Mexico, over 80% of the population is mestizo in some degree or another.[73]The Mexican philosopher and educator Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos authored an essay on the subject, La Raza C\u00f3smica, celebrating racial mixture. Venezuelan ex-president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, himself of Spanish, indigenous and African ancestry, made positive references to the mixed race ancestry of most Latin Americans from time to time.Colonialism throughout the West Indies has created diverse populations on many islands, including people of multiracial identities. Of note is the mixture of West African communities, most brought to the region as slaves and East Indian settlers most of whom came as indentured labor after the abolition of slavery. Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname claim the highest populations of such mixtures, known locally as douglas. In addition to such mixtures, many inhabitants of the West Indies can also have any combination of Amerindian, Latino, European, Chinese, Arab and Jewish heritage.According to the 2010 official census, 43.13% of Brazilians identified themselves as pardo skin color.[76] That option is normally marked by people that consider themselves multiracial (mesti\u00e7o). The Mixed Race Day or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mesti\u00e7o), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Para\u00edba and a holiday in two cities. The term pardo is formally used in the official census but is not used by the population. In Brazilian society, most people who are multiracial call themselves moreno: light-moreno or dark-moreno. Those terms are not considered offensive and focus more on skin color than on ethnicity (it is considered more like other human characteristics such as being short or tall).The most common multiracial groups are between European and African (mulatto) and Amerindian and European (caboclo or mameluco). But there are also African and Amerindian (cafuzo) and East Asian (mostly Japanese) and European/other (ainoko or more recently, h\u0101fu). All groups are more or less found throughout the whole country. Brazilian multiracials with the following three origins, Amerindian, European and African, make up the majority. It is said today[who?] that 89% or even more of the \"Pardo\" population in Brazil has at least one Amerindian ancestor (most of brancos or White Brazilian population have some Amerindian or African ancestry too despite nearly half of the country's population self-labeling as \"Caucasian\" in the censuses.[citation needed] In Brazil, it is very common for multiracial people to claim that they have no Amerindian ancestry, but studies have found[who?] that if a Brazilian multiracial can trace their ancestry back to nearly eight to nine generations, they will have at least one Amerindian ancestor from their maternal side of the family.Since multiracial relations in Brazilian society have occurred for many generations, some people find it difficult to trace their own ethnic ancestry. Today a majority of mixed-race Brazilians do not really know their ethnic ancestry. Their unique features make them Brazilian-looking in skin color, lips and nose shape or hair texture, but they are aware only that their ancestors were probably Portuguese, African or Amerindian. Also, there was a very large number of other Europeans (counted in the millions) who contributed to the Brazilian racial make up, Japanese (the largest Japanese population outside Japan), Italian (the largest Italian population outside Italy) Lebanese (the largest population of Lebanese outside Lebanon), Germans, Poles and Russians. There is also a high percentage of Brazilians of Jewish descent, perhaps hundreds of thousands, mostly found in the northeast of the country who cannot be sure of their ancestry as they descend from the so-called \"Crypto-Jews\" (Jews who practiced Judaism in secret but outwardly pretended to be Catholics), also called Marranos or New Christians, often considered Portuguese. According to some sources, one third of families arrived from Portugal during colonization were of Jewish origin.[citation needed]There is a high level of integration between all groups but also a great social and economic difference between European descendants (more common in upper and middle classes) and African, Amerindian and multiracial descendants (more common tin lower classes), which is called Brazilian apartheid.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Filipino_Americans": "Filipino Americans (Filipino: Mga Pilipinong Amerikano) are Americans of Filipino ancestry. Filipinos in North America were first documented in the 16th century[8] and other small settlements beginning in the 18th century.[9] Mass migration did not begin until after the end of the Spanish\u2013American War at the end of the 19th century, when the Philippines was ceded from Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris.[10][11]As of 2019, there were 4.2 million Filipinos, or Americans with Filipino ancestry, in the United States[12][13] with large communities in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Texas, and the New York metropolitan area.[14]The term Filipino American is sometimes shortened to Fil-Am[15] or Pinoy.[16] Another term which has been used is Philippine Americans.[17] The earliest appearance of the term Pinoy (feminine Pinay), was in a 1926 issue of the Filipino Student Bulletin.[18] Some Filipinos believe that the term Pinoy was coined by Filipinos who came to the United States to distinguish themselves from Filipinos living in the Philippines.[19] Beginning in 2017, started by individuals who identify with the LGBT+ Filipino American population, there is an effort to adopt the term FilipinX; this new term has faced opposition within the broader overseas Filipino diaspora, within the Philippines, and in the United States, with some who are in opposition believing it is an attempt of a \"colonial imposition\".[20]Filipino sailors were the first Asians in North America.[21] The first documented presence of Filipinos in what is now the United States dates back to October 1587 around Morro Bay, California,[22] with the first permanent settlement in Louisiana in 1763,[23] the settlers there were called \"Manilamen\" and they served in the Battle of New Orleans during the closing stages of the War of 1812, after the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed.[24] There were then small settlements of Filipinos beginning in the 18th century,[25] and Filipinos worked as cowboys and ranch hands in the 1800s.[26] Mass migration began in the early 20th century when, for a period following the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the Philippines was a territory of the United States. By 1904, Filipino peoples of different ethnic backgrounds were imported by the US government onto the Americas and were displayed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition as part of a human zoo.[27][28] During the 1920s, many Filipinos immigrated to the United States as unskilled labor, to provide better opportunities for their families back at home.[29]Philippine independence was recognized by the United States on July 4, 1946. After independence in 1946, Filipino American numbers continued to grow. Immigration was reduced significantly during the 1930s, except for those who served in the United States Navy, and increased following immigration reform in the 1960s.[30] The majority of Filipinos who immigrated after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 were skilled professionals and technicians.[29]The 2010 Census counted 3.4 million Filipino Americans;[31] the United States Department of State in 2011 estimated the total at 4 million, or 1.1% of the U.S. population.[32] They are the country's second largest self-reported Asian ancestry group according to 2010 American Community Survey.[33][34] They are also the largest population of Overseas Filipinos.[35] Significant populations of Filipino Americans can be found in California, Hawaii, the New York metropolitan area and Illinois.A 2019 census conducted by Pew Research Center showed that Filipino-Americans have a higher level of educational attainment and income than the national average.[36] Filipino-Americans show a higher rate of home-ownership compared to the average for all Asian-Americans.[36] As of 2014, 18% of Filipino-American households belonged to the top 10% household income distribution.[37] Among all Asians, Filipino-Americans show the lowest poverty rate at 7% after Indian Americans at 6%.Around 47% of Filipino-Americans hold management or professional jobs.[38]The history of Spanish and American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures in the Philippines.[39] Filipino American cultural identity has been described as fluid, adopting aspects from various cultures;[40] that said, there has not been significant research into the culture of Filipino Americans.[41] Fashion, dance, music, theater and arts have all had roles in building Filipino American cultural identities and communities.[42][page\u00a0needed]In areas of sparse Filipino population, they often form loosely-knit social organizations aimed at maintaining a \"sense of family\", which is a key feature of Filipino culture. These organizations generally arrange social events, especially of a charitable nature, and keep members up-to-date with local events.[43] Organizations are often organized into regional associations.[44] The associations are a small part of Filipino American life. Filipino Americans formed close-knit neighborhoods, notably in California and Hawaii.[45] A few communities have \"Little Manilas\", civic and business districts tailored for the Filipino American community.[46] In a Filipino party, shoes should be left in the front of the house and greet everyone with a hi or hello. When greeting older relatives, 'po' and 'opo' must be said in every sentence to show respect.[47]Some Filipinos have traditional Philippine surnames, such as Bacdayan or Macapagal, while others have surnames derived from Japanese, Indian, and Chinese and reflect centuries of trade with these merchants preceding European and American rule.[48][49][50][51] Reflecting its 333 years of Spanish rule, many Filipinos adopted Hispanic surnames,[49][6] and celebrate fiestas.[52]Despite being from Asia, Filipinos are sometimes called \"Latinos\" due to their historical relationship to Spanish colonialism;[53] this view is not universally accepted.[54] The Philippines experienced both Spanish and American colonial territorial status,[a] with its population seen through each nation's racial constructs.[64] This shared history may also contribute to why some Filipinos choose to also identify as Hispanic or Latino, while others may not and identify more as Asian Americans.[65] In a 2017 Pew Research Survey, only 1% of immigrants from the Philippines identified as Hispanic.[66]Due to history, the Philippines and the United States are connected culturally.[67] In 2016, there was $16.5 billion worth of trade between the two countries, with the United States being the largest foreign investor in the Philippines, and more than 40% of remittances came from (or through) the United States.[68] In 2004, the amount of remittances coming from the United States was $5 billion;[69] this is an increase from the $1.16 billion sent in 1991 (then about 80% of total remittances being sent to the Philippines), and the $324 million sent in 1988.[70] Some Filipino Americans have chosen to retire in the Philippines, buying real estate.[71][72] Filipino Americans continue to travel back and forth between the United States and the Philippines, making up more than a tenth of all foreign travelers to the Philippines in 2010;[72][73] when traveling back to the Philippines they often bring cargo boxes known as a balikbayan box.[74]Filipino and English are constitutionally established as official languages in the Philippines, and Filipino is designated as the national language, with English in wide use.[75] Many Filipinos speak American English due to American colonial influence in the country's education system and due to limited Spanish education.[76] Among Asian Americans in 1990, Filipino Americans had the smallest percentage of individuals who had problems with English.[77] In 2000, among U.S.-born Filipino Americans, three quarters responded that English is their primary language;[78] nearly half of Filipino Americans speak English exclusively.[79]In 2003, Tagalog was the fifth most-spoken language in the United States, with 1.262 million speakers;[4] by 2011, it was the fourth most-spoken language in the United States.[80] Tagalog usage is significant in California, Nevada, and Washington, while Ilocano usage is significant in Hawaii.[81] Many of California's public announcements and documents are translated into Tagalog.[82] Tagalog is also taught in some public schools in the United States, as well as at some colleges.[83] Other significant Filipino languages are Ilocano and Cebuano.[84] Other languages spoken in Filipino American households include Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Hiligaynon, Bicolano, Chavacano, and Waray.[85] However, fluency in Philippine languages tends to be lost among second- and third-generation Filipino Americans.[86] Other languages of the community include Spanish and Chinese (Hokkien and Mandarin).[5] The demonym Filipinx is a gender-neutral term that is applied only to those of Filipino heritage in the diaspora, specifically Filipino-Americans. The term is not applied to Filipinos in the Philippines.[87][88]Religious Makeup of Filipino-Americans (2012)[89]The Philippines is 90% Christian,[52][90] one of only two predominantly Christian countries in Southeast Asia, along with East Timor.[91] Following the European arrival to the Philippines by Ferdinand Magellan, Spaniards made a concerted effort to convert Filipinos to Catholicism; outside of the Muslim sultanates and animist societies, missionaries were able to convert large numbers of Filipinos.[90] and the majority are Roman Catholic, giving Catholicism a major impact on Filipino culture.[92] Other Christian denominations include Protestants (Aglipayan, Episcopalian, and others), and nontrinitarians (Iglesia ni Cristo and Jehovah's Witnesses).[92] Additionally there are those Filipinos who are Muslims, Buddhist or nonreligious; religion has served as a dividing factor within the Philippines and Filipino American communities.[92]During the early part of the United States governance in the Philippines, there was a concerted effort to convert Filipinos into Protestants, and the results came with varying success.[93] As Filipinos began to migrate to the United States, Filipino Roman Catholics were often not embraced by their American Catholic brethren, nor were they sympathetic to a Filipino-ized Catholicism, in the early 20th century.[94][95] This led to creation of ethnic-specific parishes;[94][96] one such parish was St. Columban's Church in Los Angeles.[97] In 1997, the Filipino oratory was dedicated at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, owing to increased diversity within the congregations of American Catholic parishes.[98] The first-ever American Church for Filipinos, San Lorenzo Ruiz Church in New York City, is named after the first saint from the Philippines, San Lorenzo Ruiz. This was officially designated as a church for Filipinos in July 2005, the first in the United States, and the second in the world, after a church in Rome.[99]In 2010, Filipino American Catholics were the largest population of Asian American Catholics, making up more than three fourths of Asian American Catholics.[100] In 2015, a majority (65%) of Filipino Americans identify as Catholic;[101] this is down slightly from 2004 (68%).[102] Filipino Americans, who are first generation immigrants were more likely to attend mass weekly, and tended to be more conservative, than those who were born in the United States.[103] Culturally, some traditions and beliefs rooted from the original indigenous religions of Filipinos are still known among the Filipino diaspora.[104][105]The number of Filipino restaurants does not reflect the size of the population.[106][107][108] Due to the restaurant business not being a major source of income for the community, few non-Filipinos are familiar with the cuisine.[109] Although American cuisine influenced Filipino cuisine,[110] it has been criticized by non-Filipinos.[111] Even on Oahu where there is a significant Filipino American population,[112] Filipino cuisine is not as noticeable as other Asian cuisines.[113] One study found that Filipino cuisine was not often listed in Food frequency questionnaires.[114] On television, Filipino cuisine has been criticized, such as on Fear Factor,[115] and praised, such as on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,[116] and Bizarre Foods America.[117]Filipino American chefs cook in many fine dining restaurants,[118] including Cristeta Comerford who is the executive chef in the White House,[107] though many do not serve Filipino cuisine in their restaurants.[118] Reasons given for the lack of Filipino cuisine in the U.S. include colonial mentality,[108] lack of a clear identity,[108] a preference for cooking at home[107] and a continuing preference of Filipino Americans for cuisines other than their own.[119] Filipino cuisine remains prevalent among Filipino immigrants,[120] with restaurants and grocery stores catering to the Filipino American community,[106][121] including Jollibee, a Philippines-based fast-food chain.[122]In the 2010s, successful and critically reviewed Filipino American restaurants were featured in The New York Times.[123] That same decade began a Filipino Food movement in the United States;[124] it has been criticized for gentrification of the cuisine.[125] Bon Appetit named Bad Saint in Washington, D.C. \"the second best new restaurant in the United States\" in 2016.[126] Food & Wine named Lasa, in Los Angeles, one of its restaurants of the year in 2018.[127] With this emergence of Filipino American restaurants, food critics like Andrew Zimmern have predicted that Filipino food will be \"the next big thing\" in American cuisine.[128] Yet in 2017, Vogue described the cuisine as \"misunderstood and neglected\";[129] SF Weekly in 2019, later described the cuisine as \"marginal, underappreciated, and prone to weird booms-and-busts\".[130]Filipino Americans undergo experiences that are unique to their own identities. These experiences derive from both the Filipino culture and American cultures individually and the dueling of these identities as well. These stressors, if great enough, can lead Filipino Americans into suicidal behaviors.[131] Members of the Filipino community learn early on about kapwa, which is defined as \u201cinterpersonal connectedness or togetherness.[132]\u201dWith kapwa, many Filipino Americans have a strong sense of needing to repay their family members for the opportunities that they have been able to receive. An example of this is a new college graduate feeling the need to find a job that will allow them to financially support their family and themselves. This notion comes from \u201cutang na loob,\u201d defined as a debt that must be repaid to those who have supported the individual.[133]With kapwa and utang na loob as strong forces enacting on the individual, there is an \u201call or nothing\u201d mentality that is being played out. In order to bring success back to one's family, there is a desire to succeed for one's family through living out a family's wants as opposed to one's own true desires.[134] This can manifest as one entering a career path that they are not passionate in, but select in order to help support their family.[135]Despite many of the stressors for these students deriving from family, it also becomes apparent that these are the reasons that these students are resilient. When family conflict rises in Filipino American families, there is a negative association with suicide attempts.[131] This suggests that though family is a presenting stressor in a Filipino American's life, it also plays a role for their resilience.[131] In a study conducted by Yusuke Kuroki, family connectedness, whether defined as positive or negative to each individual, served as one means of lowering suicide attempts.[131]Beginning in the late 1800s, Filipino Americans began publishing books in the United States.[136] The growth of publications for the masses in the Philippines accelerated during the American period.[136] Ethnic media serving Filipino Americans dates back to the beginning of the 20th Century.[137] In 1905, pensionados at University of California, Berkeley published The Filipino Students' Magazine.[138] One of the earliest Filipino American newspapers published in the United States, was the Philippine Independent of Salinas, California, which began publishing in 1921.[138] Newspapers from the Philippines, to include The Manila Times, also served the Filipino diaspora in the United States.[137] In 1961, the Philippine News was started by Alex Esclamado, which by the 1980s had a national reach and at the time was the largest English-language Filipino newspaper.[139] While many areas with Filipino Americans have local Filipino newspapers, one of the largest concentrations of these newspapers occur in Southern California.[140] Beginning in 1992, Filipinas began publication, and was unique in that it focused on American born Filipino Americans of the second and third generation.[137] Filipinas ended its run in 2010, however it was succeeded by Positively Filipino in 2012 which included some of the staff from Filipinas.[141] The Filipino diaspora in the United States are able to watch programming from the Philippines on television through GMA Pinoy TV and The Filipino Channel.[142][143]Filipino Americans have traditionally been socially conservative,[144] particularly with \"second wave\" immigrants;[145] the first Filipino American elected to office was Peter Aduja.[146] In the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election Republican president George W. Bush won the Filipino American vote over John Kerry by nearly a two-to-one ratio,[147] which followed strong support in the 2000 election.[148] However, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, Filipino Americans voted majority Democratic, with 50% to 58% of the community voting for President Barack Obama and 42% to 46% voting for Senator John McCain.[149][150] The 2008 election marked the first time that a majority of Filipino Americans voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.[151]According to the 2012 National Asian American Survey, conducted in September 2012,[152] 45% of Filipinos were independent or nonpartisan, 27% were Republican, and 24% were Democrats.[150] Additionally, Filipino Americans had the largest proportions of Republicans among Asian Americans who have been polled, a position which is normally held by Vietnamese Americans, leading up to the 2012 election,[152] and had the lowest job approval opinion of Obama among Asian Americans.[152][153] In a survey of Asian Americans from thirty seven cities conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, it found that of the Filipino American respondents, 65% of them voted for Obama.[154] According to an exit poll conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, it found that 71% of responding Filipino Americans voted for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 general election.[155]In a survey which was conducted by Asian Americans Advancing Justice in September 2020, of the 263 Filipino American respondents, 46% of them identified themselves as Democrats, 28% of them identified themselves as Republicans, and 16% of them identified themselves as independents.[156] According to interviews which were conducted by Anthony Ocampo, an academic, Filipino American supporters of Donald Trump cited their support for the former President based on their support for the building of a border wall, their support for tax cuts to businesses, their support for legal immigration, their belief in school choice, their opposition to abortion, their opposition to affirmative action, their antagonism towards the People's Republic of China, and their belief that Trump is not a racist.[157] There was an age divide among Filipino Americans, with older Filipino Americans more likely to support Trump or be Republicans, while younger Filipino Americans were more likely to support Biden or be Democrats.[158] In the 2020 presidential election, Philippines Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez alleges that 60% of Filipino Americans reportedly voted for Joe Biden.[159] A Filipino American was among those who participated in the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[160] Rappler alleges that the Filipino-American media has heavily repeated QAnon conspiracies.[161] Rappler further alleges that, many Filipino Americans who voted for Trump, and adhere to QAnon, cite similar political leanings in the Philippines with regard to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and anti-Chinese sentiment because China has been building artificial reefs in the South China Sea near the Philippines in the 2010s and as a result, they have recently seen the Republican Party as being more hardline with regard to the Chinese government's actions.[162]Due to scattered living patterns, it is nearly impossible for Filipino American candidates to win an election solely based on the Filipino American vote.[163] Filipino American politicians have increased their visibility over the past few decades. Ben Cayetano (Democrat), former governor of Hawaii, became the first governor of Filipino descent in the United States. The number of Congressional members of Filipino descent doubled to numbers not reached since 1937, two when the Philippine Islands were represented by non-voting Resident Commissioners, due to the 2000 Senatorial Election. In 2009 three Congress-members claimed at least one-eighth Filipino ethnicity;[164] the largest number to date. Since the resignation of Senator John Ensign in 2011[165] (the only Filipino American to have been a member of the Senate), and Representative Steve Austria (the only Asian Pacific American Republican in the 112th Congress[166]) choosing not to seek reelection and retire,[167] Representative Robert C. Scott was the only Filipino American in the 113th Congress.[168] In the 116th United States Congress, Scott was joined by Rep. TJ Cox, bringing the number of Filipino Americans in Congress to two.[169] In the 117th United States Congress, Scott once again became the sole Filipino-American Representative after Cox was defeated in a rematch against David Valadao.[170]The Citizenship Retention and Re-Acquisition Act of 2003 (Republic Act No. 9225) made Filipino Americans eligible for dual citizenship in the United States and the Philippines.[171] Overseas suffrage was first employed in the May 2004 elections in which Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was reelected to a second term.[172]By 2005, about 6,000 Filipino Americans had become dual citizens of the two countries.[173] One effect of this act was to allow Filipino Americans to invest in the Philippines through land purchases, which are limited to Filipino citizens, and, with some limitations, former citizens.[174]), vote in Philippine elections, retire in the Philippines, and participate in representing the Philippine flag. In 2013, for the Philippine general election there were 125,604 registered Filipino voters in the United States and Caribbean, of which only 13,976 voted.[175]Dual citizens have been recruited to participate in international sports events including athletes representing the Philippines who competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens,[176] and the Olympic Games in Beijing 2008.[177]The Philippine government actively encourages Filipino Americans to visit or return permanently to the Philippines via the \"Balikbayan\" program and to invest in the country.[178]Filipinos remain one of the largest immigrant groups to date with over 40,000 arriving annually since 1979.[179] The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has a preference system for issuing visas to non-citizen family members of U.S. citizens, with preference based generally on familial closeness. Some non-citizen relatives of U.S. citizens spend long periods on waiting lists.[180] Petitions for immigrant visas, particularly for siblings of previously naturalized Filipinos that date back to 1984, were not granted until 2006.[181] As of 2016[update], over 380 thousand Filipinos were on the visa wait list, second only to Mexico and ahead of India, Vietnam and China.[182] Filipinos have the longest waiting times for family reunification visas, as Filipinos disproportionately apply for family visas; this has led to visa petitions filed in July 1989 still waiting to be processed in March 2013.[183]It has been documented that Filipinos were among those naturalized due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.[184] In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 270,000 Filipino were \"unauthorized immigrants\". This was an increase of 70,000 from a previous estimate in 2000. In both years, Filipinos accounted for 2% of the total. As of 2009[update], Filipinos were the fifth-largest community of illegal immigrants behind Mexico (6.65 million, 62%), El Salvador (530,000, 5%), Guatemala (480,000, 4%), and Honduras (320,000, 3%).[185] In January 2011, the Department of Homeland Security estimate of \"unauthorized immigrants\" from the Philippines remained at 270,000.[186] By 2017, the number of Filipinos who were in the United States illegally increased to 310,000.[187] Filipinos who reside in the United States illegally are known within the Filipino community as \"TnT's\" (tago nang tago translated to \"hide and hide\").[188]Filipino Americans may be mistaken for members of other racial/ethnic groups, such as Latinos or Pacific Islanders;[189] this may lead to \"mistaken\" discrimination that is not specific to Asian Americans.[189] Filipino Americans additionally, have had difficulty being categorized, termed by one source as being in \"perpetual absence\".[190]In the period, prior to 1946, Filipinos were taught that they were Americans, and they were also presented with an idealized image of America.[179] They had official status as United States nationals.[191] When they were ill-treated and discriminated against by other Americans, Filipinos were faced with the racism which existed during that period, which undermined these ideals.[192] Carlos Bulosan later wrote about this experience in America is in the Heart. Even pensionados, who immigrated on government scholarships,[179] were treated poorly.[192]In Hawaii, Filipino Americans often have little identification with their heritage,[193] and it has been documented that many disclaim their ethnicity.[194] This may be due to the \"colonial mentality\", or the idea that Western ideals and physical characteristics are superior to their own.[195] Although categorized as Asian Americans, Filipino Americans have not fully embraced being part of this racial category due to marginalization by other Asian American groups and or the dominant American society.[196] This created a struggle within Filipino American communities over how far to assimilate.[197] The term \"white-washed\" has been applied to those who are seeking to assimilate further.[198] Those who disclaim their ethnicity lose the positive adjustment to outcomes that are found in those who have a strong, positive, ethnic identity.[195]Of the ten largest immigrant groups, Filipino Americans have the highest rate of assimilation.[199] with exception to the cuisine;[200] Filipino Americans have been described as the most \"Americanized\" of the Asian American ethnicities.[201] However, even though Filipino Americans are the second largest group among Asian Americans, community activists have described the ethnicity as \"invisible\", claiming that the group is virtually unknown to the American public,[202] and is often not seen as significant even among its members.[203] Another term for this status is forgotten minority.[204]This description has also been used in the political arena, given the lack of political mobilization.[205] In the mid-1990s it was estimated that some one hundred Filipino Americans have been elected or appointed to public office. This lack of political representation contributes to the perception that Filipino Americans are invisible.[206]The concept is also used to describe how the ethnicity has assimilated.[207] Few affirmative action programs target the group although affirmative action programs rarely target Asian Americans in general.[208] Assimilation was easier given that the group is majority religiously Christian, fluent in English, and have high levels of education.[209] The concept was in greater use in the past, before the post-1965 wave of arrivals.[210]The term invisible minority has been used for Asian Americans as a whole,[211][212] and the term \"model minority\" has been applied to Filipinos as well as other Asian American groups.[213] Filipino critics allege that Filipino Americans are ignored in immigration literature and studies.[214]As with fellow Asian Americans, Filipino Americans are viewed as \"perpetual foreigners\", even for those born in the United States.[215] This has resulted in physical attacks on Filipino Americans, as well as non-violent forms of discrimination.[216]In college and high school campuses, many Filipino American student organizations put on annual Pilipino Culture Nights to showcase dances, perform skits, and comment on the issues such as identity and lack of cultural awareness due to assimilation and colonization.[217]Filipino American gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual identities are often shaped by immigration status, generation, religion, and racial formation.[218]Mental health is a topic that is seldom spoken about among the Filipino American community because of the stigma that is attached to it.[219] In the documentary \u201cSilent Sacrifices: Voices of the Filipino American Family\u201d Patricia Heras points out that a lack of communication between 1st generation and 2nd generation Filipino American immigrants can lead to family members not understanding the personal hardships that each one goes through.[220] Some of the main topics of discussion in this documentary are depression and suicide ideation experienced by the 2nd generation youth.[220]Depression in Filipinos can sometimes be difficult to notice without digging deeper into their feelings. Filipinos can display their depression in many ways such as showing extreme suffering or smiling even when it may not seem authentic.[219] Some of the common causes of depression include: financial worries, family separation during the immigration process, and cultural conflict.[219] One of these cultural conflicts is the belief that one must base decisions on what will \u201csave face\u201d for the family.[221] A study was published in 2018 by Janet Chang and Frank Samson about Filipino American youth and their non-Filipino friends. They had found that Filipino American youth with three or more close non-Filipino friends were more likely to experience depression and anxiety more so than Filipino American youth with two or less non-Filipino friends that they considered to be close.[222] Although having friends of diverse backgrounds gave these Filipinos a sense of inclusion among their peers, they also gained a heightened awareness of discrimination.[222]During World War II, some 250,000 to 400,000 Filipinos served in the United States Military,[223][224] in units including the Philippine Scouts, Philippine Commonwealth Army under U.S. Command, and recognized guerrillas during the Japanese Occupation. In January 2013, ten thousand surviving Filipino American veterans of World War II lived in the United States, and a further fourteen thousand in the Philippines,[225] although some estimates found eighteen thousand or fewer surviving veterans.[226]The U.S. government promised these soldiers all of the benefits afforded to other veterans.[227] However, in 1946, the United States Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946 which stripped Filipino veterans of the promised benefits.[228] One estimate claims that monies due to these veterans for back pay and other benefits exceeds one billion dollars.[224] Of the sixty-six countries allied with the United States during the war, the Philippines is the only country that did not receive military benefits from the United States.[203] The phrase \"Second Class Veterans\" has been used to describe their status.[203][229]Many Filipino veterans traveled to the United States to lobby Congress for these benefits.[230] Since 1993, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress to pay the benefits, but all died in committee.[231] As recently as 2018, these bills have received bipartisan support.[232]Representative Hanabusa submitted legislation to award Filipino Veterans with a Congressional Gold Medal.[233] Known as the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, it was referred to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on House Administration.[234] As of February 2012 had attracted 41 cosponsors.[235] In January 2017, the medal was approved.[236]There was a proposed lawsuit to be filed in 2011 by The Justice for Filipino American Veterans against the Department of Veterans Affairs.[237]In the late 1980s, efforts towards reinstating benefits first succeeded with the incorporation of Filipino veteran naturalization in the Immigration Act of 1990.[203] Over 30,000 such veterans had immigrated, with mostly American citizens, receiving benefits relating to their service.[238]Similar language to those bills was inserted by the Senate into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[239] which provided a one time payment of at least 9,000 USD to eligible non-US Citizens and US$15,000 to eligible US Citizens via the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund.[240] These payments went to those recognized as soldiers or guerrillas or their spouses.[241] The list of eligibles is smaller than the list recognized by the Philippines.[242] Additionally, recipients had to waive all rights to possible future benefits.[243] As of March 2011, 42 percent (24,385) of claims had been rejected;[244] By 2017, more than 22,000 people received about $226 million in one time payments.[245]In the 113th Congress, Representative Joe Heck reintroduced his legislation to allow documents from the Philippine government and the U.S. Army to be accepted as proof of eligibility.[246] Known as H.R. 481, it was referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.[247] In 2013, the U.S. released a previously classified report detailing guerrilla activities, including guerrilla units not on the \"Missouri list\".[248]In September 2012, the Social Security Administration announced that non-resident Filipino World War II veterans were eligible for certain social security benefits; however an eligible veteran would lose those benefits if they visited for more than one month in a year, or immigrated.[249]Beginning in 2008, a bipartisan effort started by Mike Thompson and Tom Udall an effort began to recognize the contributions of Filipinos during World War 2; by the time Barack Obama signed the effort into law in 2016, a mere fifteen thousand of those veterans were estimated to be alive.[250] Of those living Filipino veterans of World War II, there were an estimated 6,000 living in the United States.[251] Finally in October 2017, the recognition occurred with the awarding of a Congressional Gold Medal.[252] When the medal was presented by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, several surviving veterans were at the ceremony.[253] The medal now resides in the National Museum of American History.[254]Congress established Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May to commemorate Filipino American and other Asian American cultures. Upon becoming the largest Asian American group in California, October was established as Filipino American History Month to acknowledge the first landing of Filipinos on October 18, 1587 in Morro Bay, California. It is widely celebrated by Fil-Ams.[255][256]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/German_Americans": "German Americans (German: Deutschamerikaner, pronounced [\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283\u0294ame\u0281i\u02ccka\u02d0n\u0250]) are Americans who have full or partial German ancestry. With an estimated size of approximately 43 million in 2019, German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the United States Census Bureau in its American Community Survey.[1] German Americans account for about one third of the total population of people of German ancestry in the world.[6][7]Very few of the German states had colonies in the new world. In the 1670s, the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the British colonies, settling primarily in Pennsylvania, New York and Virginia.The Mississippi Company of France moved thousands of Germans from Europe to Louisiana and to the German Coast, Orleans Territory between 1718 and 1750.[8]Immigration ramped up sharply, with eight million Germans arriving during the 19th century, seven and a half million \njust between 1820 and 1870.There is a \"German belt\" that extends all the way across the United States, from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast. Pennsylvania, with 3.5 million people of German ancestry, has the largest population of German-Americans in the U.S. and is home to one of the group's original settlements, Germantown (Philadelphia), founded in 1683 and the birthplace of the American antislavery movement in 1688, as well as the revolutionary Battle of Germantown.They were pulled by the attractions of land and religious freedom, and pushed out of Germany by shortages of land and religious or political oppression.[9] Many arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others for the chance to start fresh in the New World. The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off. After 1840, many came to cities, where \"Germania\"\u2014German-speaking districts\u2014soon emerged.[10][11][12]German Americans established the first kindergartens in the United States,[13] introduced the Christmas tree tradition,[14][15] and introduced popular foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers to America.[16]The great majority of people with some German ancestry have become Americanized; fewer than 5% speak German. German-American societies abound, as do celebrations that are held throughout the country to celebrate German heritage of which the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City is one of the most well-known and is held every third Saturday in September. Oktoberfest celebrations and the German-American Day are popular festivities. There are major annual events in cities with German heritage including Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, San Antonio and St. Louis.Around 180,000 German citizens are living in the United States in 2020. [17]The Germans included many quite distinct subgroups with differing religious and cultural values.[18] Lutherans and Catholics typically opposed Yankee moralizing programs such as the prohibition of beer, and favored paternalistic families with the husband deciding the family position on public affairs.[19][20] They generally opposed women's suffrage but this was used as argument in favor of suffrage when German Americans became pariahs during World War I.[21] On the other hand, there were Protestant groups who emerged from European pietism such as the German Methodist and United Brethren; they more closely resembled the Yankee Methodists in their moralism.[22]The first English settlers arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, and were accompanied by the first German American, Dr. Johannes Fleischer. He was followed in 1608 by five glassmakers and three carpenters or house builders.[23] The first permanent German settlement in what became the United States was Germantown, Pennsylvania, founded near Philadelphia on October 6, 1683.[24]Large numbers of Germans migrated from the 1680s to 1760s, with Pennsylvania the favored destination. They migrated to America for a variety of reasons.[24] Push factors involved worsening opportunities for farm ownership in central Europe, persecution of some religious groups, and military conscription; pull factors were better economic conditions, especially the opportunity to own land, and religious freedom. Often immigrants paid for their passage by selling their labor for a period of years as indentured servants.[25]Large sections of Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia attracted Germans. Most were Lutheran or German Reformed; many belonged to small religious sects such as the Moravians and Mennonites. German Catholics did not arrive in number until after the War of 1812.[26]In 1709, Protestant Germans from the Pfalz or Palatine region of Germany escaped conditions of poverty, traveling first to Rotterdam and then to London. Queen Anne helped them get to the American colonies. The trip was long and difficult to survive because of the poor quality of food and water aboard ships and the infectious disease typhus. Many immigrants, particularly children, died before reaching America in June 1710.[27]The Palatine immigration of about 2100 people who survived was the largest single immigration to America in the colonial period. Most were first settled along the Hudson River in work camps, to pay off their passage. By 1711, seven villages had been established in New York on the Robert Livingston manor. In 1723 Germans became the first Europeans allowed to buy land in the Mohawk Valley west of Little Falls. One hundred homesteads were allocated in the Burnetsfield Patent. By 1750, the Germans occupied a strip some 12 miles (19\u00a0km) long along both sides of the Mohawk River. The soil was excellent; some 500 houses were built, mostly of stone, and the region prospered in spite of Indian raids. Herkimer was the best-known of the German settlements in a region long known as the \"German Flats\".[27]They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).[28]The most famous of the early German Palatine immigrants was editor John Peter Zenger, who led the fight in colonial New York City for freedom of the press in America. A later immigrant, John Jacob Astor, who came from Baden after the Revolutionary War, became the richest man in America from his fur trading empire and real estate investments in New York.[29]John Law organized the first colonization of Louisiana with German immigrants. Of the over 5,000 Germans initially immigrating primarily from the Alsace Region as few as 500 made up the first wave of immigrants to leave France en route to the Americas. Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.The Mississippi Company settled thousands of German pioneers in French Louisiana during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the Alsatian region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the Swiss to immigrate. Alsace was sold to France within the greater context of the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648).The Jesuit Charlevoix traveled New France (Canada and Louisiana) in the early 1700s. His letter said \"these 9,000 Germans, who were raised in the Palatinate (Alsace part of France) were in Arkansas. The Germans left Arkansas en masse. They went to New Orleans and demanded passage to Europe. The Mississippi Company gave the Germans rich lands on the right bank of the Mississippi River about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) above New Orleans. The area is now known as 'the German Coast'.\"A thriving population of Germans lived upriver from New Orleans, Louisiana, known as the German Coast. They were attracted to the area through pamphlets such as J. Hanno Deiler's \"Louisiana: A Home for German Settlers\".[30]Two waves of German colonists in 1714 and 1717 founded a colony in Virginia called Germanna,[31] located near modern-day Culpeper, Virginia. Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood, taking advantage of the headright system, had bought land in present-day Spotsylvania and encouraged German immigration by advertising in Germany for miners to move to Virginia and establish a mining industry in the colony. The name \"Germanna\", selected by Governor Alexander Spotswood, reflected both the German immigrants who sailed across the Atlantic to Virginia and the British queen, Anne, who was in power at the time of the first settlement at Germanna.In North Carolina, German Moravians living around Bethlehem, Pennsylvania purchased nearly 100,000 acres (400\u00a0km2) from Lord Granville (one of the British Lords Proprietor) in the Piedmont of North Carolina in 1753. They established German settlements on that tract, especially in the area around what is now Winston-Salem.[32] They also founded the transitional settlement of Bethabara, North Carolina, translated as House of Passage, the first planned Moravian community in North Carolina, in 1759. Soon after, the German Moravians founded the town of Salem in 1766 (now a historical section in the center of Winston-Salem) and Salem College (an early female college) in 1772.In the Georgia Colony, Germans mainly from the Swabia region settled in Savannah, St. Simon's Island and Fort Frederica in the 1730s and 1740s. They were actively recruited by James Oglethorpe and quickly distinguished themselves through improved farming, advanced tabby (cement)-construction, and leading joint Lutheran-Anglican-Reformed religious services for the colonists.German immigrants also settled in other areas of the American South, including around the Dutch (Deutsch) Fork area of South Carolina,[26] and Texas, especially in the Austin and San Antonio areas.Between 1742 and 1753, roughly 1,000 Germans settled in Broad Bay, Massachusetts (now Waldoboro, Maine). Many of the colonists fled to Boston, Maine, Nova Scotia, and North Carolina after their houses were burned and their neighbors killed or carried into captivity by Native Americans. The Germans who remained found it difficult to survive on farming, and eventually turned to the shipping and fishing industries.[33]The tide of German immigration to Pennsylvania swelled between 1725 and 1775, with immigrants arriving as redemptioners or indentured servants. By 1775, Germans constituted about one-third of the population of the state. German farmers were renowned for their highly productive animal husbandry and agricultural practices. Politically, they were generally inactive until 1740, when they joined a Quaker-led coalition that took control of the legislature, which later supported the American Revolution. Despite this, many of the German settlers were loyalists during the Revolution, possibly because they feared their royal land grants would be taken away by a new republican government, or because of loyalty to a British German monarchy who had provided the opportunity to live in a liberal society.[34] The Germans, comprising Lutherans, Reformed, Mennonites, Amish, and other sects, developed a rich religious life with a strong musical culture. Collectively, they came to be known as the Pennsylvania Dutch (from Deutsch).[35][36]Etymologically, the word Dutch originates from the Old High German word \"diutisc\" (from \"diot\" \"people\"), referring to the Germanic \"language of the people\" as opposed to Latin, the language of the learned (see also theodiscus). Eventually the word came to refer to people who speak a Germanic language, and only in the last couple centuries the people of the Netherlands. Other Germanic language variants for \"deutsch/deitsch/dutch\" are: Dutch \"Duits\" and \"Diets\", Yiddish \"daytsh\", Danish/Norwegian \"tysk\", or Swedish \"tyska.\" The Japanese \"\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\" (/doitsu/) also derives from the aforementioned \"Dutch\" variations.The Studebaker brothers, forefathers of the wagon and automobile makers, arrived in Pennsylvania in 1736 from the famous blade town of Solingen. With their skills, they made wagons that carried the frontiersmen westward; their cannons provided the Union Army with artillery in the American Civil War, and their automobile company became one of the largest in America, although never eclipsing the \"Big Three\", and was a factor in the war effort and in the industrial foundations of the Army.[37]Great Britain, whose King George III was also the Elector of Hanover in Germany, hired 18,000 Hessians.  They were mercenary soldiers rented out by the rulers of several small German states such as Hesse to fight on the British side. Many were captured; they remained as prisoners during the war but some stayed and became U.S. citizens.[38] In the American Revolution the Mennonites and other small religious sects were neutral pacifists. The Lutherans of Pennsylvania were on the patriot side.[39]  The Muhlenberg family, led by Rev. Henry Muhlenberg was especially influential on the Patriot side.[40] His son Peter Muhlenberg, a Lutheran clergyman in Virginia became a major general and later a Congressman.[41][42] However, in upstate New York, many Germans were neutral or supported the Loyalist cause.From names in the 1790 U.S. census, historians estimate Germans constituted nearly 9% of the white population in the United States.[43]The brief Fries's Rebellion was an anti-tax movement among Germans in Pennsylvania in 1799\u20131800.[44]The largest flow of German immigration to America occurred between 1820 and World War\u00a0I, during which time nearly six million Germans immigrated to the United States. From 1840 to 1880, they were the largest group of immigrants. Following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, a wave of political refugees fled to America, who became known as Forty-Eighters. They included professionals, journalists, and politicians. Prominent Forty-Eighters included Carl Schurz and Henry Villard.[46]\"Latin farmer\" or Latin Settlement is the designation of several settlements founded by some of the Dreissiger and other refugees from Europe after rebellions like the Frankfurter Wachensturm beginning in the 1830s\u2014predominantly in Texas and Missouri, but also in other US states\u2014in which German intellectuals (freethinkers, German: Freidenker, and Latinists) met together to devote themselves to the German literature, philosophy, science, classical music, and the Latin language. A prominent representative of this generation of immigrants was Gustav Koerner who lived most of the time in Belleville, Illinois until his death.A few German Jews came in the colonial era. The largest numbers arrived after 1820, especially in the mid-19th century.[47] They spread across the North and South (and California, where Levi Strauss arrived in 1853). They formed small German-Jewish communities in cities and towns. They typically were local and regional merchants selling clothing; others were livestock dealers, agricultural commodity traders, bankers, and operators of local businesses. Henry Lehman, who founded Lehman Brothers in Alabama, was a particularly prominent example of such a German-Jewish immigrant. They formed Reform synagogues[48] and sponsored numerous local and national philanthropic organizations, such as B'nai B'rith.[49] This German-speaking group is quite distinct from the Yiddish-speaking East-European Jews who arrived in much larger numbers starting in the late 19th century and concentrated in New York.The port cities of New York, and Baltimore had large populations, as did Hoboken, New Jersey.Cities along the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, and the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers attracted a large German element. The Midwestern cities of Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago were favored destinations of German immigrants. The Northern Kentucky and Louisville area along the Ohio River was also a favored destination. By 1900, the populations of the cities of Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati were all more than 40% German American. Dubuque and Davenport, Iowa had even larger proportions, as did Omaha, Nebraska, where the proportion of German Americans was 57% in 1910. In many other cities of the Midwest, such as Fort Wayne, Indiana, German Americans were at least 30% of the population.[33][50] By 1850 there were 5,000 Germans, mostly Schwabians living in, and around, Ann Arbor, Michigan.[51]Many concentrations acquired distinctive names suggesting their heritage, such as the \"Over-the-Rhine\" district in Cincinnati, \"Dutchtown\" in South St Louis, and \"German Village\" in Columbus, Ohio.[52]A particularly attractive destination was Milwaukee, and came to be known as \"the German Athens\". Radical Germans trained in politics in the old country dominated the city's Socialists. Skilled workers dominated many crafts, while entrepreneurs created the brewing industry; the most famous brands included Pabst, Schlitz, Miller, and Blatz.[53]Whereas half of German immigrants settled in cities, the other half established farms in the Midwest. From Ohio to the Plains states, a heavy presence persists in rural areas into the 21st century.[26][54]Few German immigrants settled in the Deep South, apart from New Orleans, the German Coast, and Texas.[55]Texas attracted many Germans who entered through Galveston and Indianola, both those who came to farm, and later immigrants who more rapidly took industrial jobs in cities such as Houston. As in Milwaukee, Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.[26]Texas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.[57]Germans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals.[citation needed] They were Germans who had lived for generations throughout the Russian Empire, but especially along the Volga River in Russia and near the Crimea. Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by Catherine the Great in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.Negatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the Tsar, the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern Midwest saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets\u2014still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War\u00a0I, their identity was challenged by anti-German sentiment. By the end of World War\u00a0II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use loanwords, such as Kuchen for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.[58]Musician Lawrence Welk (1903-1992) became an iconic figure in the German-Russian community of the northern Great Plains\u2014his success story personified the American dream.[59]Sentiment among German Americans was largely anti-slavery, especially among Forty-Eighters.[46] Notable Forty-Eighter Hermann Raster wrote passionately against slavery and was very pro-Lincoln. Raster published anti-slavery pamphlets and was the editor of the most influential German language newspaper in America at the time.[60] He helped secure the votes of German-Americans across the United States for Abraham Lincoln. When Raster died the Chicago Tribune published an article regarding his service as a correspondent for America to the German states saying, \"His writings during and after the Civil War did more to create understanding and appreciation of the American situation in Germany and to float U.S. bonds in Europe than the combined efforts of all the U.S. ministers and consuls.\"[61] Hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteered to fight for the Union in the American Civil War (1861\u20131865).[62] The Germans were the largest immigrant group to participate in the Civil War; over 176,000 U.S. soldiers were born in Germany.[63] A popular Union commander among Germans, Major General Franz Sigel was the highest-ranking German officer in the Union Army, with many German immigrants claiming to enlist to \"fight mit Sigel\".[64]Although only one in four Germans fought in all-German regiments, they created the public image of the German soldier. Pennsylvania fielded five German regiments, New York eleven, and Ohio six.[62]Western railroads, with large land grants available to attract farmers, set up agencies in Hamburg and other German cities, promising cheap transportation, and sales of farmland on easy terms. For example, the Santa Fe railroad hired its own commissioner for immigration, and sold over 300,000 acres (1,200\u00a0km2) to German-speaking farmers.[65]Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the German Americans showed a high interest in becoming farmers, and keeping their children and grandchildren on the land. While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool \"to maintain continuity of the family\".[66] They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, \"To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land.\"[67]Germany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the Ostfriesische Nachrichten (\"East Frisian News\") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke H\u00fcndling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.[68]Relatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the Third party System (1850s\u20131890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the Republican party and the Catholics were strongly Democratic. When prohibition was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called \"Puritans\", including the temperance reformers and many Populists. The German community strongly opposed Free Silver, and voted heavily against crusader William Jennings Bryan in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President William McKinley's foreign policy.[69]At the local level, historians have explored the changing voting behavior of the German-American community and one of its major strongholds, St. Louis, Missouri. The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, led by Carl Schurz. They supported the Liberal Republican party led by Benjamin Gratz Brown for governor in 1870 and Horace Greeley for president in 1872.[70]Many Germans in late 19th century cities were communists; Germans played a significant role in the labor union movement.[71][72] A few were anarchists.[73] Eight of the forty-two anarchist defendants in the Haymarket Affair of 1886 in Chicago were German.Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg (1863\u20131916), a German psychologist, moved to Harvard in the 1890s and became a leader in the new profession. He was president of the American Psychological Association in 1898, and the American Philosophical Association in 1908, and played a major role in many other American and international organizations.[74]Arthur Preuss (1871\u20131934) was a leading journalist, and theologian. A layman in St Louis. His Fortnightly Review (in English) was a major conservative voice read closely by church leaders and intellectuals from 1894 until 1934. He was intensely loyal to the Vatican. Preuss upheld the German Catholic community, denounced the \"Americanism\" heresy, promoted the Catholic University of America, and anguished over the anti-German America hysteria during World War\u00a0I. He provided lengthy commentary regarding the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the anti-Catholic factor in the presidential campaign of 1928, the hardships of the Great Depression, and the liberalism of the New Deal.[75][76]During World War I (1914\u201318, American involvement 1917\u201318), German Americans were often accused of being too sympathetic to Imperial Germany. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced \"hyphenated Americanism\", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, such as H. L. Mencken. Similarly, Harvard psychology professor Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg dropped his efforts to mediate between America and Germany, and threw his efforts behind the German cause.[77][78] There was also some Anti-German hysteria like the killing of Pastor Edmund Kayser.The Justice Department prepared a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917\u201318. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort.[79] Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty.[80] The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining in fear of sabotage. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched.[81] A Minnesota minister was tarred and feathered when he was overheard praying in German with a dying woman.[82]   Questions of German American loyalty increased due to events like the German bombing of Black Tom island[83] and the U.S. entering World War I, many German Americans were arrested for refusing allegiance to the U.S.[84] War hysteria led to the removal of German names in public, names of things such as streets,[85] and businesses.[86] Schools also began to eliminate or discourage the teaching of the German language.[87]In Chicago, Frederick Stock temporarily stepped down as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra until he finalized his naturalization papers. Orchestras replaced music by German composer Wagner with French composer Berlioz. In Cincinnati, the public library was asked to withdraw all German books from its shelves.[88] German-named streets were renamed. The town, Berlin, Michigan, was changed to Marne, Michigan (honoring those who fought in the Battle of Marne). In Iowa, in the 1918 Babel Proclamation, the governor prohibited all foreign languages in schools and public places. Nebraska banned instruction in any language except English, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the ban illegal in 1923 (Meyer v. Nebraska).[89] The response of German Americans to these tactics was often to \"Americanize\" names (e.g., Schmidt to Smith, M\u00fcller to Miller) and limit the use of the German language in public places, especially churches.[90]American wartime propaganda depicted the bloodthirsty German \"Hun\" soldier as an enemy of civilization, with his eyes on America from across the AtlanticGerman-American farmer John Meints of Minnesota was tarred and feathered in August 1918 for allegedly not supporting war bond drives.Between 1931 and 1940, 114,000 Germans moved to the United States, many of whom\u2014including Nobel prize winner Albert Einstein and author Erich Maria Remarque\u2014were Jewish Germans or anti-Nazis fleeing government oppression.[91] About 25,000 people became paying members of the pro-Nazi German American Bund during the years before the war.[92] German aliens were the subject of suspicion and discrimination during the war, although prejudice and sheer numbers meant they suffered as a group generally less than Japanese Americans. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required 300,000 German-born resident aliens who had German citizenship to register with the Federal government and restricted their travel and property ownership rights.[93][94] Under the still active Alien Enemy Act of 1798, the United States government interned nearly 11,000 German citizens between 1940 and 1948. Civil rights violations occurred.[95] An unknown number of \"voluntary internees\" joined their spouses and parents in the camps and were not permitted to leave.[96][97][98]\nMany Americans of German ancestry had top war jobs, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and USAAF General Carl Andrew Spaatz. Roosevelt appointed Republican Wendell Willkie (who ironically ran against Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election) as a personal representative. German Americans who had fluent German language skills were an important asset to wartime intelligence, and they served as translators and as spies for the United States.[99] The war evoked strong pro-American patriotic sentiments among German Americans, few of whom by then had contacts with distant relatives in the old country.[26][100]In the aftermath of World War II, millions of ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled from their homes within the redrawn borders of Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Most resettled in Germany, but others came as refugees to the United States in the late 1940s, and established cultural centers in their new homes. Some Danube Swabians, for instance, ethnic Germans who had maintained language and customs after settlement in Hungary, later Yugoslavia (now Serbia), immigrated to the U.S. after the war.After 1970, anti-German sentiment aroused by World War II faded away.[105] Today, German Americans who immigrated after World War\u00a0II share the same characteristics as any other Western European immigrant group in the U.S. They are mostly professionals and academics who have come for professional reasons. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification of Germany, Germany has become a preferred destination for immigrants rather than a source of migrating peoples.[106]The German American community supported reunification in 1990.[107]In the 1990 U.S. Census, 58 million Americans claimed to be solely or partially of German descent.[108] According to the 2005 American Community Survey, 50 million Americans have German ancestry. German Americans represent 17% of the total U.S. population and 26% of the non-Hispanic white population.[109]The Economist magazine in 2015 interviewed Petra Sch\u00fcrmann, the director of the German-American Heritage Museum in Washington for a major article on German-Americans. She notes that all over the United States, celebrations such as German fests and Oktoberfests have been appearing.States with the highest proportions of German Americans tend to be those of the upper Midwest, including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas; all at over 30%.[1]Of the four major US regions, German was the most-reported ancestry in the Midwest, second in the West, and third in both the Northeast and the South. German was the top reported ancestry in 23 states, and it was one of the top five reported ancestries in every state except Maine and Rhode Island.[1]Estimated population by state according to the 2019 American Community Survey.[1]Estimated percentage of the population by state according to the 2019 American Community Survey rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent.[1]Today, most German Americans have assimilated to the point they no longer have readily identifiable ethnic communities, though there are still many metropolitan areas where German is the most reported ethnicity, such as Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.[110][111]The 25 U.S. communities with the highest percentage of residents claiming German ancestry are:[112]Large U.S. communities[definition needed] with a high percentage of residents claiming German ancestry are:[113][failed verification]The 25 U.S. communities with the most residents born in Germany are:[114]The Germans worked hard to maintain and cultivate their language, especially through newspapers and classes in elementary and high schools. German Americans in many cities, such as Milwaukee, brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (T\u00f6chter-Institut) to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.[117]\"Germania\" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.[118] Deutschtum was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous Vereine, associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War\u00a0I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.[119]Beginning in 1741, the German-speaking Moravian Church Settlements of Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz, Pennsylvania, and Wachovia in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. Haydn's Creation had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.The spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690\u20131768) and the Ephrata Cloister\u2014such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.[120]In most major cities, Germans took the lead in creating a musical culture, with popular bands, singing societies, operas and symphonic orchestras.[121]A small city, Wheeling, West Virginia could boast of 11 singing societies\u2014Maennerchor, Harmonie, Liedertafel, Beethoven, Concordia, Liederkranz, Germania, Teutonia, Harmonie-Maennerchor, Arion, and Mozart. The first began in 1855; the last folded in 1961. An important aspect of Wheeling social life, these societies reflected various social classes and enjoyed great popularity until anti-German sentiments during World War\u00a0I and changing social values dealt them a death blow.[122]The Liederkranz, a German-American music society, played an important role in the integration of the German community into the life of Louisville, Kentucky. Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.[123]The Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.[124]Turner societies in the United States were first organized during the mid-19th century so German American immigrants could visit with one another and become involved in social and sports activities. The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.By the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.[125]As for any immigrant population, the development of a foreign-language press helped immigrants more easily learn about their new home, maintain connections to their native land, and unite immigrant communities.[126] By the late 19th century, Germania published over 800 regular publications. The most prestigious daily newspapers, such as the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, the Anzeiger des Westens in St. Louis, and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in Chicago, promoted middle-class values and encouraged German ethnic loyalty among their readership.[127] The Germans were proud of their language, supported many German-language public and private schools, and conducted their church services in German.[128] They published at least two-thirds of all foreign language newspapers in the U.S. The papers were owned and operated in the U.S., with no control from Germany. As Wittke emphasizes, press. it was \"essentially an American press published in a foreign tongue\". The papers reported on major political and diplomatic events involving Germany, with pride but from the viewpoint of its American readers.[129][130] For example, during the latter half of the 19th century, at least 176 different German-language publications began operations in the city of Cincinnati alone. Many of these publications folded within a year, while a select few, such as the Cincinnati Freie Presse, lasted nearly a century.[131] Other cities experienced similar turnover among immigrant publications, especially from opinion press, which published little news and focused instead on editorial commentary.[132]By the end of the 19th century, there were over 800 German-language publications in the United States.[133] German immigration was on the decline, and with subsequent generations integrating into English-speaking society, the German language press began to struggle.[134] The periodicals that managed to survive in immigrant communities faced an additional challenge with anti-German sentiment during World War\u00a0I[135] and with the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which authorized censorship of foreign language newspapers.[136] Prohibition also had a destabilizing impact on the German immigrant communities upon which the German-language publications relied.[134] By 1920, there were only 278 German language publications remaining in the country.[137] After 1945, only a few publications have been started. One example is Hiwwe wie Driwwe (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only Pennsylvania German newspaper, which was established in 1997.Germans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Turner movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the Buffalo Germans basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.[138]German immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today\u2014the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod\u2014are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. Calvinist Germans founded the Reformed Church in the United States (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the Evangelical Synod of North America (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the United Church of Christ. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the Methodist church.[26] In the 1740s, Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians\u2014(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)\u2014into one \"Church of God in the Spirit\". The Moravian Church in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many \"Union\" churches in rural Pennsylvania.Before 1800, communities of Amish, Mennonites, Schwarzenau Brethren and Moravians had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the Old Order Mennonites still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as Pennsylvania Dutch. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.[139]The Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in Montana, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak Hutterite German. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.[140] The German speaking \"Russian\" Mennonites migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of \"Russian\" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.[141]Immigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or Catholic, although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.[142] Catholic Germans started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the Kulturkampf.Some 19th-century immigrants, especially the \"Forty-Eighters\", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.[143]After two or three generations, most German Americans adopted mainstream American customs \u2014 some of which they heavily influenced \u2014 and switched their language to English. As one scholar concludes, \"The overwhelming evidence\u00a0... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.\"[150] By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches). In German parochial schools, the children spoke English among themselves, though some of their classes were in German. In 1917\u201318, after the American entry into World War\u00a0I on the side of the Allies, nearly all German language instruction ended, as did most German-language church services.[90]About 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, according to the 2000 census. From 1860 to 1917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see German in the United States. There is a false belief, called the Muhlenberg legend, that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no official language, but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War\u00a0I and fell out of daily use in many places.[151]There were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The Bennett Law was a highly controversial state law passed in Wisconsin in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of parochial schools in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War\u00a0I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.[152]German Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.[153] As Melvin G. Holli puts it, \"Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.\u00a0... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers\".[154]:\u200a93\u201394\u200a[a]But this inconspicuousness was not always the case. By 1910, German Americans had created their own distinctive, vibrant, prosperous German-language communities, referred to collectively as \"Germania\". According to historian Walter Kamphoefner, a \"number of big cities introduced German into their public school programs\".[156] Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland and other cities \"had what we now call two-way immersion programs: school taught half in German, half in English\".[156] This was a tradition which continued \"all the way down to World War\u00a0I\".[156] According to Kamphoefner, German \"was in a similar position as the Spanish language is in the 20th and 21st century\"; it \"was by far the most widespread foreign language, and whoever was the largest group was at a definite advantage in getting its language into the public sphere\".[156] Kamphoefner has come across evidence that as late as 1917, a German version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was still being sung in public schools in Indianapolis.[156]Cynthia Moothart O'Bannon, writing about Fort Wayne, Indiana, states that before World War\u00a0I \"German was the primary language in the homes, churches and parochial schools\"[157] of German American settlers. She states that \"Many street signs were in German. (Main Street, for instance, was Haupt Strasse.) A large portion of local industry and commercial enterprises had at its roots German tooling and emigres. (An entire German town was moved to Fort Wayne when Wayne Knitting Mills opened.) Mayors, judges, firefighters and other community leaders had strong German ties. Social and sporting clubs and Germania Park in St. Joseph Township provided outlets to engage in traditional German activities\".[157] She goes on to state that \"The cultural influences were so strong, in fact, that the Chicago Tribune in 1893 declared Fort Wayne a 'most German town'.\"[157] Melvin G. Holli states that \"No continental foreign-born group had been so widely and favorably received in the United States, or had won such high marks from its hosts as had the Germans before World War\u00a0I. Some public opinion surveys conducted before the war showed German Americans were even more highly regarded than immigrants from the mother culture, England\".[154]:\u200a106\u200a Holli states that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra once \"had so many German-American musicians that the conductor often addressed them in the German language\",[154]:\u200a101\u200a and he states that \"No ethnic theater in Chicago glittered with such a classy repertory as did the German-American theater, or served to introduce so many European classical works to American audiences\".[154]:\u200a102The transition to the English language was abrupt, forced by federal, state and local governments, and by public opinion, when the U.S. was at war with Germany in 1917\u201318. After 1917, the German language was seldom heard in public; most newspapers and magazines closed; churches and parochial schools switched to English. Melvin G. Holli states, \"In 1917, the Missouri Synod's Lutheran Church conference minutes appeared in English for the first time, and the synod's new constitution dropped its insistence on using the language of Luther only and instead suggested bilingualism. Dozens of Lutheran schools also dropped instruction in the German language. English-language services also intruded themselves into parishes where German had been the lingua franca. Whereas only 471 congregations nationwide held English services in 1910, the number preaching in English in the synod skyrocketed to 2,492 by 1919. The German Evangelical Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other states also anglicized its name by dropping German from the title\".[154]:\u200a106\u200a Writing about Fort Wayne, Indiana, Cynthia Moothart O'Bannon states that, in the First World War, \"Local churches were forced to discontinue sermons in German, schools were pressured to stop teaching in German, and the local library director was ordered to purchase no more books written in German. The library shelves also were purged of English-language materials deemed sympathetic to or neutral on Germany. Anti-German sentiment forced the renaming of several local institutions. Teutonia Building, Loan & Savings became Home Loan & Savings, and The German-American bank became Lincoln National Bank & Trust Co.\"[157] She continues that \"in perhaps the most obvious bend to prevailing trends, Berghoff Brewery changed its motto from \"A very German brew\" to \"A very good brew,\" according to \"Fort Wayne: A Most German Town,\" a documentary produced by local public television station WFWA, Channel 39\".[157] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote how \"I could hear the pain in my German-American father's voice as he recalled being yanked out of Lutheran school during World War\u00a0I and forbidden by his immigrant parents ever to speak German again\".[158]Melvin G. Holli states, regarding Chicago, that \"After the Great War it became clear that no ethnic group was so de-ethnicized in its public expression by a single historic event as German Americans. While Polish Americans, Lithuanian Americans, and other subject nationalities underwent a great consciousness raising, German ethnicity fell into a protracted and permanent slump. The war damaged public expression of German ethnic, linguistic, and cultural institutions almost beyond repair\".[154]:\u200a106\u200a He states that, after the war, German ethnicity \"would never regain its prewar public acclaim, its larger-than-life public presence, with its symbols, rituals, and, above all, its large numbers of people who took pride in their Teutonic ancestry and enjoyed the role of Uncle Sam's favored adopted son\".[154]:\u200a107\u200a He states \"A key indicator of the decline of \"Deutschtum\" in Chicago was the census: the number identifying themselves to the census-taker as German-born plummeted from 191,000 in 1910 to 112,000 in 1920. This drop far exceeds the natural mortality rate or the number who might be expected to move. Self-identifiers had found it prudent to claim some nationality other than German. To claim German nationality had become too painful an experience\".[154]:\u200a106\u200a Along similar lines, Terrence G. Wiley states that, in Nebraska, \"around 14 percent of the population had identified itself as being of German-origin in 1910; however, only 4.4 percent made comparable assertions in 1920. In Wisconsin, the decline in percentage of those identifying themselves as Germans was even more obvious. The 1920 census reported only 6.6. percent of the population as being of German-origin, as opposed to nearly 29 percent ten years earlier\u00a0... These statistics led Burnell\u00a0... to conclude that: \"No other North American ethnic group, past or present, has attempted so forcefully to officially conceal their\u00a0... ethnic origins. One must attribute this reaction to the wave of repression that swept the Continent and enveloped anyone with a German past\"\".[159]The Catholic high schools were deliberately structured to commingle ethnic groups so as to promote ethnic (but not interreligious) intermarriage.[160] German-speaking taverns, beer gardens and saloons were all shut down by prohibition; those that reopened in 1933 spoke English.While its impact appears to be less well-known and studied than the impact which World War\u00a0I had on German Americans, World War\u00a0II was likewise difficult for them and likewise had the impact of forcing them to drop distinctive German characteristics and assimilate into the general US culture.[161][162] According to Melvin G. Holli, \"By 1930, some German American leaders in Chicago felt, as Dr. Leslie Tischauser put it, 'the damage done by the wartime experience had been largely repaired'. The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under National Socialism. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress. The overt expression of German-American opinion consequently declined, and in more recent years, virtually disappeared as a reliable index of political attitudes\u00a0...'\"[154]:\u200a108Holli goes on to state that \"The pain increased during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Congressman Martin Dies held public hearings about the menace of Nazi subversives and spies among the German Americans. In 1940, the Democratic party's attack on anti-war elements as disloyal and pro-Nazi, and the advent of the war itself, made German ethnicity too heavy a burden to bear. As Professor Tischauser wrote, \"The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere. Leaders of the German-American community would have great difficulty rebuilding an ethnic consciousness\u00a0... Few German-Americans could defend what Hitler\u00a0... had done to millions of people in pursuit of the 'final solution', and the wisest course for German-Americans was to forget any attachment to the German half of their heritage.\"\"[154]:\u200a108\u2013109A notable example which highlights the generational effect of this de-germanization on German-American cultural identity is US President Donald Trump\u2019s erroneous assertion of Swedish heritage as late as 1987 in The Art of the Deal.[163][164][165] This error stems from Donald Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, who was of German heritage but attempted to pass himself off as Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War\u00a0II. A claim which would continue to mislead his family for decades.[163]By the 1940s, Germania had largely vanished outside some rural areas and the Germans were thoroughly assimilated.[166] According to Melvin G. Holli, by the end of World War\u00a0II, German Americans \"were ethnics without any visible national or local leaders. Not even politicians would think of addressing them explicitly as an ethnic constituency as they would say, Polish Americans, Jewish Americans, or African Americans.\"[154]:\u200a109\u200a Holli states that \"Being on the wrong side in two wars had a devastating and long-term negative impact on the public celebration of German-American ethnicity\".[154]:\u200a106Historians have tried to explain what became of the German Americans and their descendants. Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War\u00a0I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as \"Nordic\" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with Irish and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from African American recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War\u00a0I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.[167]Kazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. \"Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent.\"[167]:\u200a273\u200a This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.Regarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: \"The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of the Holocaust. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War\u00a0II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry.\"[167]:\u200a273\u200a[b] Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. \"Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War\",[167]:\u200a273\u200a but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans \"ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation\".[167]:\u200a273\u200a \"The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one\".[167]:\u200a273Kazal goes on to state \"The burden of \"enemy\" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War\u00a0I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of \"100 percent Americanism\" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers\".[167]:\u200a273\u2013274\u200a As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them \"vulnerable to the wartime \"antihyphen\" climate\",[167]:\u200a274\u200a but that \"Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State\",[167]:\u200a274\u200a and that \"It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation\".[167]:\u200a274Kazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: \"German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but all of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. \"Irish American\" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats.The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding. For German Americans, religion and party politics were sources of division rather than of unity\".[167]:\u200a274\u200a Kazal goes on to state that \"The subcultures of German America, meanwhile, had ample opportunity for contact, however testy, with non-German counterparts. The latter beckoned as destinations when the cost of being German-American rose too high\".[167]:\u200a274\u200a It is not just Kazal who has pointed out the internal dividedness of the German American community. Kathleen Neils Conzen has pointed it out; David Peterson states that Conzen, \"along with many others, concludes that German-Americans' heterogeneity, particularly in religion, hampered their ability to build socially and politically stable ethnic communities\",[169]:\u200a27\u200a and that Conzen \"stresses that German Americans assimilated relatively rapidly and that their diversity played a key role in that assimilation\".[169]:\u200a47\u200a[c] (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that \"The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership\".)[170] The Encyclopedia of the Great Plains also stresses the internal dividedness, stating \"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity\u2013from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church. It is not surprising, then, that nearly all of these denominations were represented among the German immigrant population in North America.\"[171]Robert Paul McCaffery points out that \"Despite their numbers\u00a0... and unlike many immigrant groups, Germans never united as a powerful ethnic block. Religious disputes brought from the old country prevented them from uniting in the new. The two strongest denominations, Catholics and Lutherans, could not come together; and the Free Thinkers distrusted and shunned them both.\"[172]:\u200a4\u200a \"These divisions ran so deep that German-Americans could neither unite to fend off attacks engendered by World War\u00a0I, nor elect German candidates for political office\".[172]:\u200a4\u200a McCaffery states that \"Discussions of the disunity of the Germans are many\",[172]:\u200a15\u200a giving a work by Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and a work by Kathleen Neils Conzen as examples,[172]:\u200a15\u200a and he states that Leslie V. Tischauser \"maintains that neither World War\u00a0I, political questions of importance to Germans, nor German candidates could unite the German-Americans of Chicago\".[172]:\u200a16\u200a Jason Todd Baker, meanwhile, writes that \"Divided by imported regional prejudices, religious differences, political affiliations, and spread in pockets across the city, the Germans in nineteenth-century St. Louis comprised the city's largest immigrant ethnicity and possibly its least cohesive\".[173]:\u200a95He goes on to state that German Americans in St. Louis \"could not be relied upon to do much of anything as a group. St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside\".[173]:\u200a99\u200a And according to the Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, \"The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday\".[174][d]Despite the remarkable level of language assimilation reached by German Americans, distinct German usage survived well into the mid-to-late-20th century in some places. Writing about the town of Hustisford, Wisconsin, Jennifer Ludden discusses Mel Grulke, who was born in 1941, with German his first language at home; \"Grulke's great-grandparents immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1880s, yet three generations later, his farmer parents still spoke German at home, attended German language church services and chatted in German with shopkeepers when they brought their farm eggs into town to sell\".[156]Bethany Lutheran Church in Hustisford offered German-language services into the 1970s;[156] Zum Kripplein Christi, in the same county as Hustisford (Dodge County), \"offered a Sunday service in German as recently as the 1990s\";[174] St. Luke Lutheran Church, in Wishek, North Dakota, still held German-language services until as recently as about 1994;[177] St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in San Francisco still holds German-language services to this day.[178][179] Homer Rudolf, a man from North Dakota of German Russian descent, stated in 2004 that his maternal grandmother, who died in 1980 at the age of 90, \"did not learn English\".[180] As recently as 1990, one quarter of North Dakota's households included a German speaker.[181]To this day, German speakers can be found in the United States among long-established Anabaptist groups \u2013 the Old Order Amish and most Old Order Mennonites speak Pennsylvania Dutch (or Bernese German or Alsatian by a minority of Amish) along with High German to various degrees (though they are generally fluent in English).[182] All Hutterites speak Hutterite German and many \"Russian\" Mennonites speak Plautdietsch, a German dialect coming originally from the area around Danzig. The three Amish dialects as well as Hutterite German are still learned by all children of the group, whereas Plautdietsch-speakers tend much more to switch to English. Another group of German-speakers can be found in the Amana Colonies in Iowa; according to the website Statistical Atlas, all the residents of East Amana speak German at home, and only 67.7% can speak English \"very well\".[183]It has been shown that cultural differences between the attitudes towards farming of German Americans, on the one hand, and of British-ancestry \"Yankees\", on the other, lasted into the 1980s and have to some extent lasted into the 21st\u00a0century; German Americans have tended to see farming in a more family-oriented manner than Yankees.[184]Germans have contributed to a vast number of areas in American culture and technology. Baron von Steuben, a former Prussian officer, led the reorganization of the U.S. Army during the war for independence and helped make the victory against the British possible. The Steinway & Sons piano manufacturing firm was founded by immigrant Henry E. Steinway in 1853. German settlers brought the Christmas tree custom and other German Christmas traditions to the United States. The Studebakers built large numbers of wagons used during the Western migration; Studebaker, like the Duesenberg brothers, later became an important early automobile manufacturer. Carl Schurz, a refugee from the unsuccessful first German democratic revolution of 1848 became an influential politician first in the Republican then in the Democratic party, and served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior.[185]After World War II, Wernher von Braun, and most of the leading engineers from the former German V-2 rocket base at Peenem\u00fcnde, were brought to the U.S. They contributed decisively to the development of U.S. military rockets, as well as rockets for the NASA space program and the initiation of the Apollo program to land on the Moon.[186] Similarly, fellow German aviation technologist Siegfried Knemeyer, the former top aviation technologist within Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring's Reich Air Ministry during World War\u00a0II, was brought to the United States through a similar path to von Braun, and served as a civilian employee of the USAF for over twenty years.The influence of German cuisine is seen in the cuisine of the United States throughout the country, especially regarding pastries, meats and sausages, and above all, beer. Frankfurters (or \"wieners\", originating from Frankfurt am Main and Vienna, respectively), hamburgers, bratwurst, sauerkraut, and strudel are common dishes. German bakers introduced the pretzel, which is popular across the United States. Germans introduced America to lager, the most-produced beer style in the United States, and have been the dominant ethnic group in the beer industry since 1850.[26][187]The oldest extant brewery in the United States is D. G. Yuengling & Son of Pottsville, Pennsylvania (approximately 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia), founded in 1829 by an immigrant from Aldingen in what is today Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg; the brewery's flagship product remains a 19th-century German-style amber lager.[188] By the late 19th century, Milwaukee, with a large population of German origin, was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries owned by ethnic Germans (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller) and was the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Almost half of all current beer sales in the United States can be attributed to German immigrants, Capt. A. Pabst, Eberhard Anheuser, and Adolphus Busch, who founded Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis in 1860.[189] Later German immigrants figured prominently in the rebirth of craft brews following Prohibition, culminating in the microbrew movement that swept the U.S. beginning in the late 1980s.German and German-American celebrations, such as Oktoberfest, Rhenish Carnival, German-American Day and Von Steuben Day are held regularly throughout the country. One of the largest is the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City, held every third Saturday in September. There are also major annual events in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood, a traditional a center of the city's German population, in Cincinnati, where its annual Oktoberfest Zinzinnati[190] is the largest Oktoberfest outside of Germany[191] and in Milwaukee, which celebrates its German heritage with an annual German Fest.[110] Many of the immigrants from Germany and other German-speaking countries came to Pennsylvania to what was then \"Allegheny City\" (now part of the North Side of the City of Pittsburgh). So many German speakers arrived, the area became known as \"Deutschtown\" and has been revived as such.[192][193] Within Deutschtown and since 1854, The Teutonia M\u00e4nnerchor has been promoting and furthering German cultural traditions.[194]Skat, the most popular card game in Germany, is also played in areas of the United States with large German American populations, such as Wisconsin and Texas.[110]The following German international schools are in operation in the United States, serving German citizens, Americans, and other U.S. residents:German Americans have been influential in almost every field in American society, including science, architecture, business, sports, entertainment, theology, politics, and the military.German American general/flag military officers Baron von Steuben, George Armstrong Custer, John Pershing, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chester W. Nimitz, Carl Andrew Spaatz and Norman Schwarzkopf commanded the United States Army in the American Revolutionary War, American Civil War, Indian Wars, World War\u00a0I, World War\u00a0II, and the Persian Gulf War, respectively.German Americans were famous American politicians, including Carl Schurz, Friedrich Hecker, Frederick Muhlenberg, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Dwight D. Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Henry Kissinger, John Boehner and Donald Trump.Many German Americans have played a prominent role in American industry and business, including Henry J. Heinz (H. J. Heinz Company), Frank Seiberling (Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company), Walt Disney (Disney), John D. Rockefeller (Standard Oil), William Boeing (The Boeing Company and United Airlines), Walter Chrysler (Chrysler Corporation), Frederick and August Duesenberg (Duesenberg Automobile Corporation), Studebaker brothers (Studebaker Automobile Corporation), George Westinghouse (Westinghouse Electric Corporation), Levi Strauss (Levi Strauss & Co.), Charles Guth (PepsiCo Inc.), Bill Gates (Microsoft Corporation), Jawed Karim (YouTube), Elon Musk (SolarCity, SpaceX and Tesla Motors), James L. Kraft (Kraft Foods Inc.), Henry E. Steinway (Steinway & Sons), Charles Pfizer (Pfizer, Inc.), John Jacob Astor (Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts), Conrad Hilton (Hilton Hotels & Resorts), Guggenheim family (Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation), (Guggenheim Partners), Marcus Goldman and Samuel Sachs (The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.), Lehman Brothers (Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Charles Diebold (Diebold Nixdorf), Bernard Kroger (Kroger), Carl Laemmle (Universal Studios), Marcus Loew (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.), Harry Cohn (Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.), Herman Hollerith (International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)), Steve Jobs (Apple Inc.),[195] Michael Dell (Dell Inc.), Eric Schmidt (Google Inc. and Alphabet Inc.), Peter Thiel (PayPal Inc.), Adolph Simon Ochs and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger (The New York Times), Charles Bergstresser (The Wall Street Journal), Al Neuharth (USA Today), Eugene Meyer (The Washington Post) etc.German Americans were pioneers and dominated beer brewing for much of American history, beginning with breweries founded in the 19th century by German immigrants August Schell (August Schell Brewing Company), Christian Moerlein (Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.), Eberhard Anheuser and Adolphus Busch (Anheuser-Busch, currently part of AB InBev), Adolph Coors (Molson Coors Brewing Company), Frederick Miller (Miller Brewing Company), Frederick Pabst (Pabst Brewing Company), Bernhard Stroh (Stroh Brewery Company) and Joseph Schlitz (Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company).[189]Some, such as Brooklyn Bridge engineer John A. Roebling and architects Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, left behind visible landmarks.Others, including Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Wernher von Braun, Linus Pauling, John Peter Zenger, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Weizenbaum set intellectual landmarks while Neil Armstrong was the first human to land on the moon.Still others, such as Bruce Willis, George Eyser, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jack Nicklaus, Dale Earnhardt, Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff (Doris Day), Grace Kelly, Clark Gable, Marlene Dietrich, Johnny Weissmuller, Ernst Lubitsch, Walter Damrosch, Henry John Deutschendorf (John Denver), John Kay, Heidi Klum, Meryl Streep, Marlon Brando, Kim Basinger, Kevin Costner, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, David Hasselhoff, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kirsten Dunst, and Kevin George Knipfing (Kevin James) became prominent athletes, actors, film directors or artists.[196]There have been three presidents whose fathers were of German descent: Dwight D. Eisenhower (original family name Eisenhauer and maternal side is also German/Swiss), Herbert Hoover (original family name Huber), and Donald Trump (whose paternal grandparents, Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump immigrated from Kallstadt in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1902).Presidents with maternal German ancestry include Harry Truman, whose maternal grandfather Solomon Young was a descendant of Johann Georg Jung and Hans Michael Gutknecht, who emigrated from Germany together in 1752,[197] Richard Milhous Nixon, whose maternal ancestors were Germans who anglicized Melhausen to Milhous,[198] and Barack Obama, whose maternal family's ancestry includes German immigrants from the South German town of Besigheim[199] and from Bischwiller in the Alsace region that is nowadays part of France; both families came to America around 1750.[200] Lyndon B. Johnson, Grover Cleveland, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush and Theodore Roosevelt Jr had at least one German ancestor, but they did not emphasize it.[201]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Irish_Americans": "Irish Americans or Hiberno-Americans (Irish: Gael-Mheirice\u00e1naigh)[10] are Americans who have full or partial ancestry from Ireland. About 32 million Americans \u2014 9.7% of the total population \u2014 identified as being Irish in the 2019 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.[1][2]Irish Catholic~12,000,000[2]Irish Catholic ancestry~20,000,000Irish Protestant~27,000,000[2]Some of the first Irish people to travel to the New World did so as members of the Spanish garrison in Florida during the 1560s, and small numbers of Irish colonists were involved in efforts to establish colonies in the Amazon region, in Newfoundland, and in Virginia between 1604 and the 1630s. According to historian Donald Akenson, there were \"few if any\" Irish were forcibly transported to the Americas during this period.[14]Irish immigration to the Americas was the result of a series of complex causes. The Tudor conquest and subsequent colonization during the 16th and 17th centuries had led to widespread social upheaval in Ireland, and drove many Irish people to try and seek a better life elsewhere; this coincided with the rapid establishment of European colonies in the Americas, offering a source of emigration for prospective migrants. Most Irish immigrants to the Americas came as indentured servants, though others were merchants and landowners who served as key players in a variety of different mercantile and colonizing enterprises.[14]Significant numbers of Irish laborers began traveling to English colonies such as Virginia, the Leeward Islands, and Barbados in the 1620s.[15]:\u200a56\u20137Half of the Irish immigrants to the United States in its colonial era (1607\u20131775) came from the Irish province of Ulster, while the other half came from the other three provinces (Leinster, Munster and Connacht).[16] In the 17th century, immigration from Ireland to the Thirteen Colonies was minimal,[17][18] confined mostly to male indentured servants who were primarily Catholic[18][19] and peaked with 8,000 prisoner-of-war penal transports to the Chesapeake Colonies from the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 1650s (out of a total of approximately 10,000 Catholic immigrants from Ireland to the United States prior to the American Revolutionary War in 1775).[18][20][21][22]Indentured servitude in British America emerged in part due to the high cost of passage across the Atlantic Ocean,[23][24] and as a consequence, which colonies indentured servants immigrated to depended upon which colonies their patrons chose to immigrate to.[25] While the Colony of Virginia passed laws prohibiting the free exercise of Catholicism during the colonial period,[26] the General Assembly of the Province of Maryland enacted laws in 1639 protecting freedom of religion (following the instructions of a 1632 letter from Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore to his brother Leonard Calvert, the 1st Proprietary-Governor of Maryland), and the Maryland General Assembly later passed the 1649 Maryland Toleration Act explicitly guaranteeing those privileges for Catholics.[27]Like the entire indentured servant population in the Chesapeake Colonies at the time, 40 to 50 percent died before completing their contracts. This was due in large part to the Tidewater region's highly malignant disease environment, with most not establishing families and dying childless because the population of the Chesapeake Colonies, like the Thirteen Colonies in the aggregate, was not sex-balanced until the 18th century because three-quarters of the immigrants to the Chesapeake Colonies were male (and in some periods, 4:1 or 6:1 male-to-female) and fewer than 1 percent were over the age of 35. As a consequence, the population only grew due to sustained immigration rather than natural increase, and many of those who survived their indentured servitude contracts left the region.[28][29][30]In 1650, all five Catholic churches with regular services in the eight British American colonies were located in Maryland.[31] The 17th-century Maryland Catholic community had a high degree of social capital. Catholic-Protestant interdenominational marriage was not common, Catholic-Protestant intermarriages nearly always resulted in conversion to Catholicism by Protestant marital partners, and children who were born as the result of Catholic-Protestant intermarriages were nearly always raised as Catholics.[32] Additionally, 17th-century Maryland Catholics often stipulated in their wills that their children be disinherited if they renounced Catholicism.[33]In contrast to 17th-century Maryland, the Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut Colonies restricted suffrage to members of the established Puritan church, while the Province of Carolina did not restrict suffrage to members of the established Anglican church. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations had no established church, while the former New Netherland colonies (New York, New Jersey, and Delaware) also had no established church under the Duke's Laws, and the Frame of Government in William Penn's 1682 land grant established free exercise of religion for all Christians in the Province of Pennsylvania.[34][35]Following the Glorious Revolution (1688\u20131689), Catholics were disenfranchised in Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Carolina, and Virginia,[34] although in Maryland, suffrage was restored in 1702.[36] In 1692, the Maryland General Assembly established the Church of England as the official state church.[37] In 1698 and 1699, Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina passed laws specifically limiting immigration of Irish Catholic indentured servants.[38] In 1700, the estimated population of Maryland was 29,600,[39] about 2,500 of which were Catholic.[40]In the 18th century, emigration from Ireland to the Thirteen Colonies shifted from being primarily Catholic to being primarily Protestant, and with the exception of the 1790s it would remain so until the mid-to-late 1830s,[41][42] with Presbyterians constituting the absolute majority until 1835.[43][44] These Protestant immigrants were principally descended from Scottish and English pastoralists and colonial administrators (often from the South/Lowlands of Scotland and the bordering North of England) who had in the previous century settled the Plantations of Ireland, the largest of which was the Plantation of Ulster,[45][46][47] and these Protestant immigrants primarily migrated as families rather than as individuals.[48]In Ireland, they are referred to as the \"Ulster Scots\" and the \"Anglo-Irish\" respectively, and because the Protestant population in Ireland was and remains concentrated in Ulster, and because after the partition of Ireland in the 20th century Protestants in Northern Ireland on census reports have largely since self-identified their national identity as \"British\" rather than \"Irish\" or \"Northern Irish,\" Protestants in Ireland are collectively referred to as the \"Ulster Protestants.\"[49]Additionally, the Ulster Scots and Anglo-Irish intermarried to some degree,[50] and the Ulster Scots also intermarried with Huguenot refugees from the Kingdom of France following the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau issued by Louis XIV,[51][52] and some of the Anglo-Irish settlers were actually Welsh or Manx.[53][54] They seldom intermarried with the Irish Catholic population in part because intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics was banned by the Penal Laws (1691\u20131778) that gave rise the Protestant Ascendancy,[list 1] which rendered any children who were born to extralegal Catholic-Protestant intermarriages illegitimate and legally ineligible to inherit their parents' property under English law (while Presbyterian marriages were not even recognized by the state).[57]In turn, the canon law of the Catholic Church also designated Catholic-Protestant intermarriages illegitimate until Pope Pius VI extended Pope Benedict XIV's matrimonial dispensation to Ireland in 1785 for the Tametsi decree of the Council of Trent (1563),[58] and Irish Catholics almost never converted to Protestant churches during the Reformation.[59] Catholic-Protestant intermarriage would remain rare in Ireland through the early 20th century.[60]In 1704, the Maryland General Assembly passed a law which banned the Jesuits from proselytizing, baptizing children other than those with Catholic parents, and publicly conducting Catholic Mass. Two months after its passage, the General Assembly modified the legislation to allow Mass to be privately conducted for an 18-month period. In 1707, the General Assembly passed a law which permanently allowed Mass to be privately conducted. During this period, the General Assembly also began levying taxes on the passage of Irish Catholic indentured servants. In 1718, the General Assembly required a religious test for voting that resumed disenfranchisement of Catholics.[61]However, lax enforcement of penal laws in Maryland (due to its population being overwhelmingly rural) enabled churches on Jesuit-operated farms and plantations to grow and become stable parishes.[62] In 1750, of the 30 Catholic churches with regular services in the Thirteen Colonies, 15 were located in Maryland, 11 in Pennsylvania, and 4 in the former New Netherland colonies.[63] By 1756, the number of Catholics in Maryland had increased to approximately 7,000,[64] which increased further to 20,000 by 1765.[62] In Pennsylvania, there were approximately 3,000 Catholics in 1756 and 6,000 by 1765 (the large majority of the Pennsylvania Catholic population was from Germany).[62][64][65]From 1717 to 1775, though scholarly estimates vary, the most common approximation is that 250,000 immigrants from Ireland emigrated to the Thirteen Colonies.[list 2] By the beginning of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, approximately only 2 to 3 percent of the colonial labor force was composed of indentured servants, and of those arriving from Britain from 1773 to 1776, fewer than 5 percent were from Ireland (while 85 percent remained male and 72 percent went to the Southern Colonies).[75] Immigration during the war came to a standstill except by 5,000 German mercenaries from Hesse who remained in the country following the war.[42] Out of the 115 killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill, 22 were Irish-born. Their names include Callaghan, Casey, Collins, Connelly, Dillon, Donohue, Flynn, McGrath, Nugent, Shannon, and Sullivan[76]By the end of the war in 1783, there were approximately 24,000 to 25,000 Catholics in the United States (including 3,000 slaves) out of a total population of approximately 3 million (or less than 1 percent).[39][20][77][78] The majority of the Catholic population in the United States during the colonial period came from England, Germany, and France, not Ireland,[20] despite failed academic efforts by Irish historiographers to demonstrate Irish Catholics as being more numerous in the colonial period than previous scholarship had indicated.[79] By 1790, approximately 400,000 people of Irish birth or ancestry lived in the United States (or greater than 10 percent of the total population of approximately 3.9 million).[16][80] The U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates 2% of the United States population in 1776 was of native Irish heritage.[81] The Catholic population grew to approximately 50,000 by 1800 (or less than 1 percent of the total population of approximately 5.3 million) due to increased Catholic emigration from Ireland during the 1790s.[42][78][82][83]In the 18th-century Thirteen Colonies and the independent United States, while interethnic marriage among Catholics remained a dominant pattern, Catholic-Protestant intermarriage became more common (notably in the Shenandoah Valley where intermarriage among Ulster Protestants and the significant minority of Irish Catholics in particular was not uncommon or stigmatized),[84] and while fewer Catholic parents required that their children be disinherited in their wills if they renounced Catholicism, it remained more common among Catholic parents to do so if their children renounced their parents faith in proportion to the rest of the U.S. population.[77]Despite this, many Irish Catholics that immigrated to the United States from 1770 to 1830 converted to Baptist and Methodist churches during the Second Great Awakening (1790\u20131840).[85][86] In between the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 and the War of 1812, 100,000 immigrants came from Ulster to the United States.[43] During the French Revolutionary Wars (1792\u20131802) and Napoleonic Wars (1803\u20131815), there was a 22-year economic expansion in Ireland due to increased need for agricultural products for British soldiers and an expanding population in England. Following the conclusion of the War of the Seventh Coalition and Napoleon's exile to Saint Helena in 1815, there was a six-year international economic depression that led to plummeting grain prices and a cropland rent spike in Ireland.[43][87]From 1815 to 1845, 500,000 more Irish Protestant immigrants came from Ireland to the United States,[43][88] as part of a migration of approximately 1 million immigrants from Ireland from 1820 to 1845.[87] In 1820, following the Louisiana Purchase in 1804 and the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1819, the Catholic population of the United States had grown to 195,000 (or approximately 2 percent of the total population of approximately 9.6 million).[89][90] By 1840, along with resumed immigration from Germany by the 1820s,[91] the Catholic population grew to 663,000 (or approximately 4 percent out of the total population of 17.1 million).[92][93] Following the potato blight in late 1845 that initiated the Great Famine in Ireland, from 1846 to 1851, more than 1 million more Irish immigrated to the United States, 90 percent of whom were Catholic.[41][94]Many of the Famine immigrants to New York City required quarantine on Staten Island or Blackwell's Island and thousands died from typhoid fever or cholera for reasons directly or indirectly related to the Famine.[95] By 1850, following the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848) that left a residual population of 80,000 Mexicans in the Southwestern United States,[96] and along with increasing immigration from Germany,[97] the Catholic population in the United States had grown to 1.6 million (or approximately 7 percent of the total population of approximately 23.2 million).[89][98] Despite the small increase in Catholic-Protestant intermarriage following the American Revolutionary War,[77] Catholic-Protestant intermarriage remained uncommon in the United States in the 19th century.[99]Historians have characterized the etymology of the term \"Scotch-Irish\" as obscure,[100] and the term itself as misleading and confusing to the extent that even its usage by authors in historic works of literature about the Scotch-Irish (such as The Mind of the South by W. J. Cash) is often incorrect.[101][56][102] Historians David Hackett Fischer and James G. Leyburn note that usage of the term is unique to North American English and it is rarely used by British historians, or in Scotland or Ireland.[103][104] The first recorded usage of the term was by Elizabeth I of England in 1573 in reference to Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlanders who crossed the Irish Sea and intermarried with the Irish Catholic natives of Ireland.[100]While Protestant immigrants from Ireland in the 18th century were more commonly identified as \"Anglo-Irish,\" and while some preferred to self-identify as \"Anglo-Irish,\"[103] usage of \"Scotch-Irish\" in reference to Ulster Scots who immigrated to the United States in the 18th century likely became common among Episcopalians and Quakers in Pennsylvania, and records show that usage of the term with this meaning was made as early as 1757 by the Anglo-Irish philosopher Edmund Burke.[105][106]However, multiple historians have noted that from the time of the American Revolutionary War until 1850, the term largely fell out of usage, because most Ulster Protestants self-identified as \"Irish\" until large waves of immigration by Irish Catholics both during and after the 1840s Great Famine in Ireland led those Ulster Protestants in America who lived in proximity to the new immigrants to change their self-identification from \"Irish\" to \"Scotch-Irish,\"[list 3] while those Ulster Protestants who did not live in proximity to Irish Catholics continued to self-identify as \"Irish,\" or as time went on, to start self-identifying as being of \"American ancestry.\"[109]While those historians note that renewed usage of \"Scotch-Irish\" after 1850 was motivated by anti-Catholic prejudices among Ulster Protestants,[107][108] considering the historically low rates of intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics in both Ireland and the United States,[list 4] as well as the relative frequency of interethnic and interdenominational marriage amongst Protestants in Ulster,[list 5] and the fact that not all Protestant migrants from Ireland historically were Ulster Scots,[68] James G. Leyburn argued for retaining its usage for reasons of utility and preciseness,[110] while historian Wayland F. Dunaway also argued for retention for historical precedent and linguistic description.[111]During the colonial period, Scots-Irish settled in the southern Appalachian backcountry and in the Carolina Piedmont.[112] They became the primary cultural group in these areas, and their descendants were in the vanguard of westward movement through Virginia into Tennessee and Kentucky, and thence into Arkansas, Missouri and Texas. By the 19th century, through intermarriage with settlers of English and German ancestry, the descendants of the Scots-Irish lost their identification with Ireland. \"This generation of pioneers...was a generation of Americans, not of Englishmen or Germans or Scots-Irish.\"[113] The two groups had little initial interaction in America, as the 18th-century Ulster immigrants were predominantly Protestant and had become settled largely in upland regions of the American interior, while the huge wave of 19th-century Catholic immigrant families settled primarily in the Northeast and Midwest port cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Buffalo, or Chicago. However, beginning in the early 19th century, many Irish migrated individually to the interior for work on large-scale infrastructure projects such as canals and, later in the century, railroads.[114]The Scots-Irish settled mainly in the colonial \"back country\" of the Appalachian Mountain region, and became the prominent ethnic strain in the culture that developed there.[115] The descendants of Scots-Irish settlers had a great influence on the later culture of the Southern United States in particular and the culture of the United States in general through such contributions as American folk music, country and western music, and stock car racing, which became popular throughout the country in the late 20th century.[116]Irish immigrants of this period participated in significant numbers in the American Revolution, leading one British Army officer to testify at the House of Commons that \"half the rebels (referring to soldiers in the Continental Army) were from Ireland.\"[117] Irish Americans signed the foundational documents of the United States\u2014the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution\u2014and, beginning with Andrew Jackson, served as president.In 1820 Irish-born John England became the first Catholic bishop in the mainly Protestant city of Charleston, South Carolina. During the 1820s and 1830s, Bishop England defended the Catholic minority against Protestant prejudices. In 1831 and 1835, he established free schools for free African American children. Inflamed by the propaganda of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a mob raided the Charleston post office in 1835 and the next day turned its attention to England's school. England led Charleston's \"Irish Volunteers\" to defend the school. Soon after this, however, all schools for \"free blacks\" were closed in Charleston, and England acquiesced.[118]Two pairs of Irish empresarios founded colonies in coastal Texas in 1828. John McMullen and James McGloin honored the Irish saint when they established the San Patricio Colony south of San Antonio; James Power and James Hewetson contracted to create the Refugio Colony on the Gulf Coast. The two colonies were settled mainly by Irish, but also by Mexicans and other nationalities. At least 87 Irish-surnamed individuals settled in the Peters Colony, which included much of present-day north-central Texas, in the 1840s. The Irish participated in all phases of Texas' war of independence against Mexico. Among those who died defending the Alamo in March 1836 were 12 who were Irish-born, while an additional 14 bore Irish surnames. About 100 Irish-born soldiers participated in the Battle of San Jacinto \u2013 about one-seventh of the total force of Texians in that conflict.[119]The Irish Catholics concentrated in a few medium-sized cities, where they were highly visible, especially in Charleston, Savannah and New Orleans.[120][121]  They often became precinct leaders in the Democratic Party Organizations, opposed abolition of slavery, and generally favored preserving the Union in 1860, when they voted for Stephen Douglas.[122]After secession in 1861, the Irish Catholic community supported the Confederate States of America and 20,000 Irish Catholics served in the Confederate States Army. Gleason says:Support for Irish Confederate soldiers from home was vital both for encouraging them to stay in the army and to highlight to native white southerners that the entire Irish community was behind the Confederacy. Civilian leaders of the Irish and the South did embrace the Confederate national project and most became advocates of a 'hard-war' policy.[123][124]Irish nationalist John Mitchel lived in Tennessee and Virginia during his exile from Ireland and was one of the Southern United States' most outspoken supporters during the American Civil War through his newspapers the Southern Citizen and the Richmond Enquirer.[125]Although most began as unskilled laborers, Irish Catholics in the South achieved average or above average economic status by 1900. David T. Gleeson emphasizes how well they were accepted by society:Native tolerance, however, was also a very important factor in Irish integration [into Southern society].... Upper-class southerners, therefore, did not object to the Irish, because Irish immigration never threatened to overwhelm their cities or states.... The Irish were willing to take on potentially high-mortality occupations, thereby sparing valuable slave property. Some employers objected not only to the cost of Irish labor but also to the rowdiness of their foreign-born employees. Nevertheless, they recognized the importance of the Irish worker to the protection of slavery.... The Catholicism practiced by Irish immigrants was of little concern to Southern natives.[126]Before the 1800s, Irish immigrants to North America often moved to the countryside.  Some worked in the fur trade, trapping and exploring, but most settled in rural farms and villages.  They cleared the land of trees, built homes, and planted fields.  Many others worked in coastal areas as fishers, on ships, and as dockworkers. In the 1800s, Irish immigrants in the United States tended to stay in the large cities where they landed.[127]Between 1851 and 1920, 3.3 to 3.7 million Irish immigrated to the United States,[128][16] including more than 90 percent of the more than 1 million Ulster Protestant emigrants out of Ireland from 1851 to 1900.[129][94] Following the Great Famine (1845\u20131852), emigration from Ireland came primarily from Munster and Connacht,[129] while 28 percent of all immigrants from Ireland from 1851 to 1900 continued to come from Ulster. Ulster immigration continued to account for as much as 20 percent of all immigration from Ireland to the United States in the 1880s and 1890s,[94] and still accounted for 19 percent of all immigration from Ireland to the United States from 1900 to 1909 and 25 percent from 1910 to 1914.[130] The Catholic population in the United States grew to 3.1 million by 1860 (or approximately 10 percent of the total U.S. population of 31.4 million),[131][132] to 6.3 million by 1880 (or approximately 13 percent of the total U.S. population of 50.2 million),[133][134] and further to 19.8 million by 1920 (or approximately 19 percent of the total U.S. population of 106 million).[133][135]However, due to continued immigration from Germany,[97] and beginning in the 1880s, waves of immigration from Italy, Poland, and Canada (by French Canadians) as well as from Mexico from 1900 to 1920,[136] Irish Catholics never accounted for a majority of the Catholic population in the United States through 1920.[137][138] In the 1920s, an additional 220,000 immigrants from Ireland came to the United States,[16]  with emigration from Ulster falling off to 10,000 of 126,000 immigrants from Ireland (or less than 10 percent) between 1925 and 1930.[130] Following the Immigration Act of 1924 and the Great Depression,[139][140] from 1930 to 1975, only 141,000 more immigrants came from Ireland to the United States.[16] Improving economic conditions during the Post\u2013World War II economic expansion and the passage of the restrictive Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 contributed to the decline in mass immigration from Ireland.[140] Due to the early 1980s recession, 360,000 Irish emigrated out of the country, with the majority going to England and many to the United States (including approximately 40,000 to 150,000 on overstayed travel visas as undocumented aliens).[141]Beginning in the 1970s, surveys of self-identified Irish Americans found that consistent majorities of Irish Americans also self-identified as being Protestant.[142][143] While there was a greater total number of immigrants after immigration from Ireland transitioned to being primarily Catholic in the mid-to-late 1830s,[41][48][43][44] fertility rates in the United States were lower from 1840 to 1970 after immigration from Ireland became primarily Catholic than they were from 1700 to 1840 when immigration was primarily Protestant.[144][145][146] Also, while Irish immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century had higher fertility rates than the U.S. population as a whole, they had lower fertility rates than German immigrants to the United States during the same time period and lower fertility rates than the contemporaneous population of Ireland, and subsequent generations had lower fertility rates than the emigrant generation.[147] This is due to the fact that despite coming from the rural regions of an agrarian society, Irish immigrants in the post-Famine migration generally immigrated to the urban areas of the United States because by 1850 the costs of moving to a rural area and establishing a farm was beyond the financial means of most Irish immigrants.[148] In the 1990s, the Irish economy began to boom again, and by the turn of the 21st century, immigration to Ireland from the United States began to consistently exceed immigration from Ireland to the United States.[149]Irish immigration had greatly increased beginning in the 1830s due to the need for unskilled labor in canal building, lumbering, and construction works in the Northeast.[150] The large Erie Canal project was one such example where Irishmen were many of the laborers. Small but tight communities developed in growing cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.From 1820 to 1860, 1,956,557 Irish arrived, 75% of these after the Great Irish Famine (or The Great Hunger, Irish: An Gorta M\u00f3r) of 1845\u20131852, struck.[151] According to a 2019 study, \"the sons of farmers and illiterate men were more likely to emigrate than their literate and skilled counterparts. Emigration rates were highest in poorer farming communities with stronger migrant networks.\"[152]Of the total Irish immigrants to the U.S. from 1820 to 1860, many died crossing the ocean due to disease and dismal conditions of what became known as coffin ships.[150]Most Irish immigrants to the United States during this period favored large cities because they could create their own communities for support and protection in a new environment.[153]   Cities with large numbers of Irish immigrants included Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, as well as Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, St. Paul, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.The 309 Connemara emigrants, selected by their local clergy as suitable for a new life in America, arrived at Boston June 14, 1880, 11 days after departure from Galway Bay on the SS Austrian, an Allen Line ship. The settling of 'The Connemaras', as they became known, was a new venture prompted by a Liverpool priest, Fr Patrick Nugent renowned for his 'philantropic and truly patriotic exertions to alleviate the social conditions of his fellow countrymen in England'; and Archbishop John Ireland, of St Paul, Minnesota, who was already settling thousands of Irish Catholics who were trapped in the ghettoes of New York and elsewhere, on rich prairie lands.\n[154][155]While many Irish did stay near large cities, countless others were part of westward expansion. They were enticed by tales of gold, and by the increasing opportunities for work and land. In 1854, the government opened Kansas Territory to settlers.[156] While many people in general moved to take advantage of the unsettled land, Irish were an important part. Many Irish men were physical laborers. In order to colonize the west, many strong men were needed to build the towns and cities. Kansas City was one city that was built by Irish immigrants.[156]  Much of its population today is of Irish descent.  Another reason for Irish migration west was the expansion of railroads. Railway work was a common occupation among immigrant men because workers were in such high demand. Many Irish men followed the expansion of railroads, and ended up settling in places that they built in.[157] Since the Irish were a large part of those Americans moving west, much of their culture can still be found today.During the American Civil War, Irish Americans volunteered for the Union Army and at least 38 Union regiments had the word \"Irish\" in their titles. 144,221 Union soldiers were born in Ireland; additionally, perhaps an equal number of Union soldiers were of Irish descent.[158] Many immigrant soldiers formed their own regiments, such as the Irish Brigade.[159][160][161] However, in proportion to the general population, the Irish were the most underrepresented immigrant group fighting for the Union.[162]However, conscription was resisted by many Irish as an imposition.[160][161] Two years into the war, the conscription law was passed in 1863, and major draft riots erupted in New York. It coincided with the efforts of the city's dominant political machine, Tammany Hall, to enroll Irish immigrants as citizens so they could vote in local elections.[163]  Many such immigrants suddenly discovered they were now expected to fight for their new country.[164]  The Irish, employed primarily as laborers, were usually unable to afford the $300 \"commutation fee\" to procure a replacement for service.[165] Many of the Irish viewed blacks as competition for scarce jobs, and as the reason why the Civil War was being fought.[166] African Americans who fell into the mob's hands were often beaten or killed.[167][168] The Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue, which provided shelter for hundreds of children, was attacked by a mob. It was seen as a \"symbol of white charity to blacks and of black upward mobility,\" reasons enough for its destruction at the hands of a predominantly Irish mob which looked upon African Americans as direct social and economic competitors.[169] Fortunately, the largely Irish-American police force was able to secure the orphanage for enough time to allow orphans to escape.[167][170]30,000 Irish or Irish-descended men joined the Confederate Army.[162] Interestingly, Gleeson wrote that they had higher desertion rates than non-Irish, and sometimes switched sides, suggesting that their support for the Confederacy was tepid.[171] During the Reconstruction era, however, some Irish took a strong position in favor of white supremacy, and some played major roles in attacking blacks in riots in Memphis.[172]In 1871, New York's Orange Riots broke out when Irish Protestants celebrated the Williamite victory at the Battle of the Boyne by parading through Irish Catholic neighborhoods, taunting the residents who then responded with violence.  Police Superintendent James J. Kelso, a Protestant, ordered the parade cancelled as a threat to public safety. Kelso was overruled by the governor, who ordered 5000 militia to protect the marchers.[173] The Catholics attacked but were stopped by the militia and police, who opened fire killing about 63 Catholics.[174]Relations between the U.S. and Britain were chilly during the 1860s as Americans resented instances of British and Canadian support for the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the war American authorities looked the other way as Irish Catholic \"Fenians\" plotted and even attempted an invasion of Canada.[175] The Fenians provCed a failure,[clarification needed] but Irish Catholic politicians (Who were a growing power in the Democratic Party) demanded more independence for Ireland and made anti-British rhetoric\u2014called \"twisting the lion's tail\"\u2014a staple of election campaign appeals to the Irish Catholic vote.[176]Later immigrants mostly settled in industrial towns and cities of the Northeast and Midwest where Irish American neighborhoods had previously been established.[177][178]The Irish were having a huge impact on America as a whole. In 1910, there were more people in New York City of Irish ancestry than Dublin's whole population, and even today, many of these cities still retain a substantial Irish-American community.[179] The best urban economic opportunities for unskilled Irish women and men included \"factory and millwork, domestic service, and the physical labor of public work projects.\"[180]During the mid-1900s, immigrants from Ireland were coming to the U.S. for the same reasons as those before them; they came looking for jobs.[181]Religion has been important to the Irish American identity in America, and continues to play a major role in their communities. Surveys conducted since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of those who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry in the United States as also self-identifying as Protestants.[142][143] The Protestants' ancestors arrived primarily in the colonial era, while Catholics are primarily descended from immigrants of the 19th century. Irish leaders have been prominent in the Catholic Church in the United States for over 150 years. The Irish have been leaders in the Presbyterian and Methodist traditions, as well.[182]Surveys in the 1990s show that of Americans who identify themselves as \"Irish\", 51% said they were Protestant and 36% identified as Catholic. In the Southern United States, Protestants account for 73% of those claiming Irish origins, while Catholics account for 19%. In the Northern United States, 45% of those claiming Irish origin are Catholic, while 39% are Protestant.[182] Many African Americans and Native Americans claim Irish Protestant and Scots-Irish ancestry.[183] Although, native Irish names and surnames are pretty common among the African American people, who are mostly Protestant, this is due to the two communities intermarrying. These intermarriages took place mostly in the 19th century, as members of both communities were treated as second class citizens in the United States.[184]  African Americans with Ulster Scots ancestry largely originated from Ulster Scots slave owners, just like their Scottish kin who owned 33% of all slaves in Jamaica.[185]Between 1607 and 1820, the majority of emigrants from Ireland to America were Protestants [186] who were described simply as \"Irish\".[187] The religious distinction became important after 1820,[188] when large numbers of Irish Catholics began to emigrate to the United States. Some of the descendants of the colonial Irish Protestant settlers from Ulster began thereafter to redefine themselves as \"Scotch Irish\", to stress their historic origins, and distanced themselves from Irish Catholics;[189] others continued to call themselves Irish, especially in areas of the South which saw little Irish Catholic immigration. By 1830, Irish diaspora demographics had changed rapidly, with over 60% of all Irish settlers in the US being Catholics from rural areas of Ireland.[190]Some Protestant Irish immigrants became active in explicitly anti-Catholic organizations such as the Orange Institution and the American Protective Association. However, participation in the Orange Institution was never as large in the United States as it was in Canada.[191] In the early nineteenth century, the post-Revolutionary republican spirit of the new United States attracted exiled United Irishmen such as Theobald Wolf Tone and others, with the presidency of Andrew Jackson exemplifying this attitude.[192] Most Protestant Irish immigrants in the first several decades of the nineteenth century were those who held to the republicanism of the 1790s, and who were unable to accept Orangeism. Loyalists and Orangemen made up a minority of Irish Protestant immigrants to the United States during this period. Most of the Irish loyalist emigration was bound for Upper Canada and the Canadian Maritime provinces, where Orange lodges were able to flourish under the British flag.[191]By 1870, when there were about 930 Orange lodges in the Canadian province of Ontario, there were only 43 in the entire eastern United States. These few American lodges were founded by newly arriving Protestant Irish immigrants in coastal cities such as Philadelphia and New York.[193] These ventures were short-lived and of limited political and social impact, although there were specific instances of violence involving Orangemen between Catholic and Protestant Irish immigrants, such as the Orange Riots in New York City in 1824, 1870 and 1871.[194]The first \"Orange riot\" on record was in 1824, in Abingdon Square, New York, resulting from a 12 July march. Several Orangemen were arrested and found guilty of inciting the riot. According to the State prosecutor in the court record, \"the Orange celebration was until then unknown in the country.\" The immigrants involved were admonished: \"In the United States the oppressed of all nations find an asylum, and all that is asked in return is that they become law-abiding citizens. Orangemen, Ribbonmen, and United Irishmen are alike unknown. They are all entitled to protection by the laws of the country.\"[195]The later Orange Riots of 1870 and 1871 killed nearly 70 people, and were fought out between Irish Protestant and Catholic immigrants. After this the activities of the Orange Order were banned for a time, the Order dissolved, and most members joined Masonic orders. After 1871, there were no more riots between Irish Catholics and Protestants.[196]America offered a new beginning, and \"...most descendents of the Ulster Presbyterians of the eighteenth century and even many new Protestant Irish immigrants turned their backs on all associations with Ireland and melted into the American Protestant mainstream.\"[197]Irish priests (especially Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Capuchins) came to the large cities of the East in the 1790s, and when new dioceses were erected in 1808 the first bishop of New York was an Irishman in recognition of the contribution of the early Irish clergy.[198]Saint Patrick's Battalion (San Patricios) was a group of several hundred immigrant soldiers, the majority Irish, who deserted the U.S. Army during the Mexican\u2013American War because of ill treatment or sympathetic leanings to fellow Mexican Catholics. They joined the Mexican army.[199]In Boston between 1810 and 1840 there had been serious tensions between the bishop and the laity who wanted to control the local parishes. By 1845, the Catholic population in Boston had increased to 30,000 from around 5,000 in 1825, due to the influx of Irish immigrants. With the appointment of John B. Fitzpatrick as bishop in 1845, tensions subsided as the increasingly Irish Catholic community grew to support Fitzpatrick's assertion of the bishop's control of parish government.[200]In New York, Archbishop John Hughes (1797\u20131864), an Irish immigrant himself, was deeply involved in \"the Irish question\"\u2014Irish independence from British rule. Hughes supported Daniel O'Connell's Catholic emancipation movement in Ireland, but rejected such radical and violent societies as the Young Irelanders and the National Brotherhood. Hughes also disapproved of American Irish radical fringe groups, urging immigrants to assimilate themselves into American life while remaining patriotic to Ireland \"only individually\".[201] In Hughes's view, a large-scale movement to form Irish settlements in the western United States was too isolationist and ultimately detrimental to immigrants' success in the New World.[202]In the 1840s, Hughes campaigned for publicly-funded schools for Catholic immigrants from Ireland modelled after the successful Irish public school system in Lowell, Massachusetts. Hughes made speeches denouncing the Public School Society of New York, which mandated that all educational institutions use the King James Bible, an unacceptable proposition to Catholics. The dispute between Catholics and Protestants over the funding of schools led the New York Legislature to pass the Maclay Act in 1842, giving New York City an elective Board of Education empowered to build and supervise schools and distribute the education fund\u2014but with the proviso that none of the money should go to schools which taught religion. Hughes responded by building an elaborate parochial school system that stretched to the college level, setting a policy followed in other large cities. Efforts to get city or state funding failed because of vehement Protestant opposition to a system that rivaled the public schools.[203]In the west, Catholic Irish were having a large effect as well. The open west attracted many Irish immigrants. Many of these immigrants were Catholic. When they migrated west, they would form \"little pockets\" with other Irish immigrants.[156] Irish Catholic communities were made in \"supportive, village style neighborhoods centered around a Catholic church and called 'parishes'\".[156] These neighborhoods affected the overall lifestyle and atmosphere of the communities. Other ways religion played a part in these towns was the fact that many were started by Irish Catholic priests. Father Bernard Donnelly started \"Town of Kansas\" which would later become Kansas City. His influence over early stages Kansas City was great, and so the Catholic religion was spread to other settlers who arrived.[156] While not all settlers became Catholics, a great number of the early settlers were Catholic. In other western communities, Irish priests wanted to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism.[156] These Catholic Irish would contribute not only to the growth of Catholic population in America, but to the values and traditions in America.Jesuits established a network of colleges in major cities, including Boston College, Fordham University in New York, and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Fordham was founded in 1841 and attracted students from other regions of the United States, and even South America and the Caribbean. At first exclusively a liberal arts institution, it built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum there. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created.[204] Boston College, by contrast, was established over twenty years later in 1863 to appeal to urban Irish Catholics. It offered a rather limited intellectual curriculum, however, with the priests at Boston College prioritizing spiritual and sacramental activities over intellectual pursuits. One consequence was that Harvard Law School would not admit Boston College graduates to its law school. Modern Jesuit leadership in American academia was not to become their hallmark across all institutions until the 20th century.[205]The Irish became prominent in the leadership of the Catholic Church in the U.S. by the 1850s\u2014by 1890 there were 7.3 million Catholics in the U.S. and growing, and most bishops were Irish.[206] As late as the 1970s, when Irish were 17% of American Catholics, they were 35% of the priests and 50% of the bishops, together with a similar proportion of presidents of Catholic colleges and hospitals.[207]The Scots-Irish who settled in the back country of colonial America were largely Presbyterians.[208] The establishment of many settlements in the remote back-country put a strain on the ability of the Presbyterian Church to meet the new demand for qualified, college-educated clergy.[209] Religious groups such as the Baptists and Methodists did not require higher education of their ministers, so they could more readily supply ministers to meet the demand of the growing Scots-Irish settlements.[209] By about 1810, Baptist and Methodist churches were in the majority, and the descendants of the Scotch-Irish today remain predominantly Baptist or Methodist.[210] They were avid participants in the revivals taking place during the Great Awakening from the 1740s to the 1840s.[211] They take pride in their Irish heritage because they identify with the values ascribed to the Scotch-Irish who played a major role in the American Revolution and in the development of American culture.[182]The first Presbyterian community in America was established in 1640 in Southampton, Long Island New York.[212] Francis Makemie, an Irish Presbyterian immigrant later established churches in Maryland and Virginia.[213] Makemie was born and raised near Ramelton, County Donegal, to Ulster Scots parents. He was educated in the University of Glasgow and set out to organize and initiate the construction of several Presbyterian Churches throughout Maryland and Virginia. By 1706, Makemie and his followers constructed  a Presbyterian Church in Rehobeth, Maryland.[214][215] In 1707, after traveling to New York to establish a presbytery, Francis Makemie was charged with preaching without a license by the English immigrant and Governor of New York, Edward Hyde.[216] Makemie won a vital victory for the fight of religious freedom for Scots-Irish immigrants when he was acquitted and gained recognition for having \"stood up to Anglican authorities\". Makemie became one of the wealthiest immigrants to colonial America, owning more than 5,000 acres and 33 slaves.[217][218]New Light Presbyterians founded the College of New Jersey, later renamed Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers dedicated to their views. The college was the educational and religious capital of Scots-Irish America.[219] By 1808, loss of confidence in the college within the Presbyterian Church led to the establishment of the separate Princeton Theological Seminary, but deep Presbyterian influence at the college continued through the 1910s, as typified by university president Woodrow Wilson.[220]Out on the frontier, the Scots-Irish Presbyterians of the Muskingum Valley in Ohio established Muskingum College at New Concord in 1837. It was led by two clergymen, Samuel Wilson and Benjamin Waddle, who served as trustees, president, and professors during the first few years. During the 1840s and 1850s the college survived the rapid turnover of very young presidents who used the post as a stepping stone in their clerical careers, and in the late 1850s it weathered a storm of student protest. Under the leadership of L. B. W. Shryock during the Civil War, Muskingum gradually evolved from a local and locally controlled institution to one serving the entire Muskingum Valley. It is still affiliated with the Presbyterian church.[221]Brought up in a Scots-Irish Presbyterian home, Cyrus McCormick of Chicago developed a strong sense of devotion to the Presbyterian Church. Throughout his later life, he used the wealth gained through invention of the mechanical reaper to further the work of the church. His benefactions were responsible for the establishment in Chicago of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of the Northwest (after his death renamed the McCormick Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church). He assisted the Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia. He also supported a series of religious publications, beginning with the Presbyterian Expositor in 1857 and ending with the Interior (later called The Continent), which his widow continued until her death.[222]Irish immigrants were the first immigrant group to America to build and organize Methodist churches. Many of the early Irish immigrants who did so came from a German-Irish background. Barbara Heck, an Irish woman of German descent from County Limerick, Ireland, immigrated to America in 1760, with her husband, Paul. She is often considered to be the \"Mother of American Methodism.\"[223] Heck guided and mentored her cousin, Philip Embury, who was also an \"Irish Palatine\" immigrant.[224] Heck and Embury constructed the John Street Methodist Church, which today is usually recognized as the oldest Methodist Church in the United States.[225] However, another church constructed by prominent Irish Methodist immigrant, Robert Strawbridge, may have preceded the John Street Methodist Church.[226]The Irish people were the first of many to immigrate to the U.S. in mass waves, including large groups of single young women between the ages of 16 and 24.[227] Up until this point, free women who settled in the colonies mostly came after their husbands had already made the journey and could afford their trip, or were brought over to be married to an eligible colonist who paid for their journey. Many Irish fled their home country to escape unemployment and starvation during the Great Irish Famine.[228] The richest of the Irish resettled in England, where their skilled work was greatly accepted, but lower class Irish and women could find little work in Western Europe, leading them to cross the Atlantic in search of greater financial opportunities.[229]Some Irish women resorted to prostitution in large cities such as Boston and New York City. They were often arrested for intoxication, public lewdness, and petty larceny.[230]  Most of the single Irish women preferred service labor as a form of income. These women made a higher wage than most by serving the middle and high-class in their own homes as nannies, cooks and cleaners. The wages for domestic service were higher than that of factory workers and they lived in the attics of upscale mansions. By 1870, forty percent of Irish women worked as domestic servants in New York City, making them over fifty percent of the service industry at the time.[231]Prejudices ran deep in the north and could be seen in newspaper cartoons depicting Irish men as hot-headed, violent drunkards.[232] The initial backlash the Irish received in America lead to their self-imposed seclusion, making assimilation into society a long and painful process.[228]Down to the end of the 19th century a large number of Irish immigrants arrived speaking Irish as their first language. This continued to be the case with immigrants from certain counties even in the 20th century. The Irish language was first mentioned as being spoken in North America in the 17th century. Large numbers of Irish emigrated to America throughout the 18th century, bringing the language with them, and it was particularly strong in Pennsylvania.[233] It was also  widely spoken in such places as New York City, where it proved a useful recruiting tool for Loyalists during the American Revolution.[234][235]Irish speakers continued to arrive in large numbers throughout the 19th century, particularly after the Famine. There was a certain amount of literacy in Irish, as shown by the many Irish-language manuscripts which immigrants brought with them. In 1881 An Gaodhal was founded, being the first newspaper in the world to be largely in Irish. It continued to be published into the 20th century,[236] and now has an online successor in An Gael, an international literary magazine.[237] A number of Irish immigrant newspapers in the 19th and 20th centuries had Irish language columns.Irish immigrants fell into three linguistic categories: monolingual Irish speakers, bilingual speakers of both Irish and English, and monolingual English speakers.[238] Estimates indicate that there were around 400,000 Irish speakers in the United States in the 1890s, located primarily in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and Yonkers.[239] The Irish-speaking population of New York reached its height in this period, when speakers of Irish numbered between 70,000 and 80,000.[240] This number declined during the early 20th century, dropping to 40,000 in 1939, 10,000 in 1979, and 5,000 in 1995.[241]According to the 2000 census, the Irish language ranks 66th out of the 322 languages spoken today in the U.S., with over 25,000 speakers. New York state has the most Irish speakers of the 50 states, and Massachusetts the highest percentage.[242]Dalta\u00ed na Gaeilge, a nonprofit Irish language advocacy group based in Elberon, New Jersey, estimated that about 30,000 people spoke the language in America as of 2006. This, the organization claimed, was a remarkable increase from only a few thousand at the time of the group's founding in 1981.[243]Before 1800, significant numbers of Irish Protestant immigrants became farmers; many headed to the frontier where land was cheap or free and it was easier to start a farm or herding operation.[244] Many Irish Protestants and Catholics alike were indentured servants, unable to pay their own passage or sentenced to servitude.[245]After 1840, most Irish Catholic immigrants went directly to the cities, mill towns, and railroad or canal construction sites on the East Coast. In upstate New York, the Great Lakes area, the Midwest and the Far West, many became farmers or ranchers. In the East, male Irish laborers were hired by Irish contractors to work on canals, railroads, streets, sewers and other construction projects, particularly in New York state and New England. The Irish men also worked in these labor positions in the mid-west. They worked to construct towns where there had been none previously. Kansas City was one such town, and eventually became an important cattle town and railroad center.[156]Labor positions weren't the only occupations for Irish, though. Some moved to New England mill towns, such as Holyoke, Lowell, Taunton, Brockton, Fall River, and Milford, Massachusetts, where owners of textile mills welcomed the new, low-wage workers. They took the jobs previously held by Yankee women known as Lowell girls.[246][247][248] A large percentage of Irish Catholic women took jobs as maids in hotels and private households.[120]Large numbers of unemployed or very poor Irish Catholics lived in squalid conditions in the new city slums and tenements.[249]Single, Irish immigrant women quickly assumed jobs in high demand but for very low pay. The majority of them worked in mills, factories, and private households and were considered the bottommost group in the female job hierarchy, alongside African American women. Workers considered mill work in cotton textiles and needle trades the least desirable because of the dangerous and unpleasant conditions. Factory work was primarily a worst-case scenario for widows or daughters of families already involved in the industry.[250]Unlike many other immigrants, Irish women preferred domestic work because it was constantly in great demand among middle- and upper-class American households.[251] Although wages differed across the country, they were consistently higher than those of the other occupations available to Irish women and could often be negotiated because of the lack of competition. Also, the working conditions in well-off households were significantly better than those of factories or mills, and free room and board allowed domestic servants to save money or send it back to their families in Ireland.[252]Despite some of the benefits of domestic work, Irish women's job requirements were difficult and demeaning. Subject to their employers around the clock, Irish women cooked, cleaned, babysat and more. Because most servants lived in the home where they worked, they were separated from their communities. Most of all, the American stigma on domestic work suggested that Irish women were failures who had \"about the same intelligence as that of an old grey-headed negro.\" This quote illustrates how, in a period of extreme racism towards African Americans, society similarly viewed Irish immigrants as inferior beings.[253]Although the Irish Catholics started very low on the social status scale, by 1900 they had jobs and earnings about equal on average to their neighbors. This was largely due to their ability to speak English when they arrived. The Irish were able to rise quickly within the working world, unlike non-English speaking immigrants.[254] Yet there were still many shanty and lower working class communities in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, and other parts of the country.[255]After 1945, the Catholic Irish consistently ranked at the top of the social hierarchy, thanks especially to their high rate of college attendance, and due to that many Irish American men have risen to higher socio-economic table.[256]In the 19th century, jobs in local government were distributed by politicians to their supporters, and with significant strength in city hall the Irish became candidates for positions in all departments, such as  police departments, fire departments, public schools and other public services of major cities. In 1897 New York City was formed by consolidating its five boroughs. That created 20,000 new patronage jobs. New York invested heavily in large-scale public works. This produced thousands of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in subways, street railways, waterworks, and port facilities. Over half the Irish men employed by the city worked in utilities. Across all ethnic groups In New York City, municipal employment grew from  54,000 workers in 1900 to 148,000 in 1930.[257]  In New York City, Albany, and Jersey City, about one third of the Irish of the first and second generation had municipal jobs in 1900.[258]By 1855, according to New York Police Commissioner George W. Matsell (1811\u20131877),[259] almost 17 percent of the police department's officers were Irish-born (compared to 28.2 percent of the city) in a report to the Board of Aldermen;[260] of the NYPD's 1,149 men, Irish-born officers made up 304 of 431 foreign-born policemen.[120] In the 1860s more than half of those arrested in New York City were Irish born or of Irish descent but nearly half of the city's law enforcement officers were also Irish. By the turn of the 20th century, five out of six NYPD officers were Irish born or of Irish descent. As late as the 1960s, 42% of the NYPD were Irish Americans.[261]Up to the 20th and early 21st century, Irish Catholics continue to be prominent in the law enforcement community, especially in the Northeastern United States. The Emerald Society, an Irish American fraternal organization, was founded in 1953 by the NYPD.[262] When the Boston chapter of the Emerald Society formed in 1973, half of the city's police officers became members.Towards the end of the 19th century, schoolteaching became the most desirable occupation for the second generation of female Irish immigrants. Teaching was similar to domestic work for the first generation of Irish immigrants in that it was a popular job and one that relied on a woman's decision to remain unmarried.[263] The disproportionate number of Irish-American Catholic women who entered the job market as teachers in the late 19th century and early 20th century from Boston to San Francisco was a beneficial result of the Irish National school system. Irish schools prepared young single women to support themselves in a new country, which inspired them to instill the importance of education, college training, and a profession in their American-born daughters even more than in their sons.[264]Evidence from schools in New York City illustrate the upward trend of Irish women as teachers: \"as early as 1870, twenty percent of all schoolteachers were Irish women, and...by 1890 Irish females comprised two-thirds of those in the Sixth Ward schools.\" Irish women attained admirable reputations as schoolteachers, which enabled some to pursue professions of even higher stature.[264]Upon arrival in the United States, many Irish women became Catholic nuns and participated in the many American sisterhoods, especially those in St. Louis in Missouri, St. Paul in Minnesota, and Troy in New York. Additionally, the women who settled in these communities were often sent back to Ireland to recruit. This kind of religious lifestyle appealed to Irish female immigrants because they outnumbered their male counterparts and the Irish cultural tendency to postpone marriage often promoted gender separation and celibacy. Furthermore, \"the Catholic church, clergy, and women religious were highly respected in Ireland,\" making the sisterhoods particularly attractive to Irish immigrants.[265]Nuns provided extensive support for Irish immigrants in large cities, especially in fields such as nursing and teaching but also through orphanages, widows' homes, and housing for young, single women in domestic work.[266] Although many Irish communities built parish schools run by nuns, the majority of Irish parents in large cities in the East enrolled their children in the public school system, where daughters or granddaughters of Irish immigrants had already established themselves as teachers.[267]Anti-Irish sentiment was rampant in the United States during the 19th and early 20th Century.[269] Rising Nativist sentiments among Protestant Americans in the 1850s led to increasing discrimination against Irish Americans. Prejudice against Irish Catholics in the U.S. reached a peak in the mid-1850s with the Know Nothing Movement, which tried to oust Catholics from public office. After a year or two of local success, the Know Nothing Party vanished.[270]Catholics and Protestants kept their distance; intermarriage between Catholics and Protestants was uncommon, and strongly discouraged by both Protestant ministers and Catholic priests. As Dolan notes, \"'Mixed marriages', as they were called, were allowed in rare cases, though warned against repeatedly, and were uncommon.\"[271] Rather, intermarriage was primarily with other ethnic groups who shared their religion. Irish Catholics, for example, would commonly intermarry with German Catholics or Poles in the Midwest and Italians in the Northeast.Irish-American journalists \"scoured the cultural landscape for evidence of insults directed at the Irish in America.\" Much of what historians know about hostility to the Irish comes from their reports in Irish and in Democratic newspapers.[272]While the parishes were struggling to build parochial schools, many Catholic children attended public schools. The Protestant King James Version of the Bible was widely used in public schools, but Catholics were forbidden by their church from reading or reciting from it.[273]  Many Irish children complained that Catholicism was openly mocked in the classroom. In New York City, the curriculum vividly portrayed Catholics, and specifically the Irish, as villainous.[274]The Catholic archbishop John Hughes, an immigrant to America from County Tyrone, Ireland, campaigned for public funding of Catholic education in response to the bigotry. While never successful in obtaining public money for private education, the debate with the city's Protestant elite spurred by Hughes' passionate campaign paved the way for the secularization of public education nationwide. In addition, Catholic higher education expanded during this period with colleges and universities that evolved into such institutions as Fordham University and Boston College providing alternatives to Irish who were not otherwise permitted to apply to other colleges.Many Irish work gangs were hired by contractors to build canals, railroads, city streets and sewers across the country.[120] In the South, they underbid slave labor.[275] One result was that small cities that served as railroad centers came to have large Irish populations.[276]In 1895, the Knights of Equity was founded, to combat discrimination against Irish Catholics in the U.S., and to assist them financially when needed.Irish Catholics were popular targets for stereotyping in the 19th century. According to historian George Potter, the media often stereotyped the Irish in America as being boss-controlled, violent (both among themselves and with those of other ethnic groups), voting illegally, prone to alcoholism and dependent on street gangs that were often violent or criminal. Potter quotes contemporary newspaper images:You will scarcely ever find an Irishman dabbling in counterfeit money, or breaking into houses, or swindling; but if there is any fighting to be done, he is very apt to have a hand in it.\" Even though Pat might \"'meet with a friend and for love knock him down,'\" noted a Montreal paper, the fighting usually resulted from a sudden excitement, allowing there was \"but little 'malice prepense' in his whole composition.\" The Catholic Telegraph of Cincinnati in 1853, saying that the \"name of 'Irish' has become identified in the minds of many, with almost every species of outlawry,\" distinguished the Irish vices as \"not of a deep malignant nature,\" arising rather from the \"transient burst of undisciplined passion,\" like \"drunk, disorderly, fighting, etc., not like robbery, cheating, swindling, counterfeiting, slandering, calumniating, blasphemy, using obscene language, &c.[277]The Irish had many humorists of their own, but were scathingly attacked in political cartoons, especially those in Puck magazine from the 1870s to 1900; it was edited by secular Germans who opposed the Catholic Irish in politics. In addition, the cartoons of Thomas Nast were especially hostile; for example, he depicted the Irish-dominated Tammany Hall machine in New York City as a ferocious tiger.[278]The stereotype of the Irish as violent drunks has lasted well beyond its high point in the mid-19th century. For example, President Richard Nixon once told advisor Charles Colson that \"[t]he Irish have certain \u2014 for example, the Irish can't drink. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks. Particularly the real Irish.\"[279]Discrimination against Irish Americans differed depending on gender. For example, Irish women were sometimes stereotyped as \"reckless breeders\" because some American Protestants feared high Catholic birth rates would eventually result in a Protestant minority. Many native-born Americans claimed that \"their incessant childbearing [would] ensure an Irish political takeover of American cities [and that] Catholicism would become the reigning faith of the hitherto Protestant nation.\"[280] Irish men were also targeted, but in a different way than women were. The difference between the Irish female \"Bridget\" and the Irish male \"Pat\" was distinct; while she was impulsive but fairly harmless, he was \"always drunk, eternally fighting, lazy, and shiftless\". In contrast to the view that Irish women were shiftless, slovenly and stupid (like their male counterparts), girls were said to be \"industrious, willing, cheerful, and honest\u2014they work hard, and they are very strictly moral\".[281][282]There were also Social Darwinian-inspired excuses for the discrimination of the Irish in America. Many Americans believed that since the Irish were Celts and not Anglo-Saxons, they were racially inferior and deserved second-class citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by many Americans. This notion was held due to the fact that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to insane asylums and poorhouses than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that many Americans had at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.[283]From the 1860s onwards, Irish Americans were stereotyped as terrorists and gangsters, although this stereotyping began to diminish by the end of the 19th century.[284]The annual celebration of Saint Patrick's Day is a widely recognized symbol of the Irish presence in America. The largest celebration of the holiday takes place in New York, where the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade draws an average of two million people. The second-largest celebration is held in Boston. The South Boston Parade is one of the USA's oldest, dating back to 1737. Savannah, Georgia, also holds one of the largest parades in the United States.Since the arrival of nearly two million Irish immigrants in the 1840s, the urban Irish police officer and firefighter have become virtual icons of American popular culture. In many large cities, the police and fire departments have been dominated by the Irish for over 100 years, even after the ethnic Irish residential populations in those cities dwindled to small minorities. Many police and fire departments maintain large and active \"Emerald Societies\", bagpipe marching groups, or other similar units demonstrating their members' pride in their Irish heritage.While these archetypal images are especially well known, Irish Americans have contributed to U.S. culture in a wide variety of fields: the fine and performing arts, film, literature, politics, sports, and religion. The Irish-American contribution to popular entertainment is reflected in the careers of figures such as James Cagney, Bing Crosby, Walt Disney, John Ford, Judy Garland,[285] Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly, Tyrone Power, Chuck Connors, Ada Rehan, Jena Malone, and Spencer Tracy. Irish-born actress Maureen O'Hara,[286] who became an American citizen, defined for U.S. audiences the archetypal, feisty Irish \"colleen\" in popular films such as The Quiet Man and The Long Gray Line. More recently, the Irish-born Pierce Brosnan gained screen celebrity as James Bond. During the early years of television, popular figures with Irish roots included Gracie Allen, Art Carney, Joe Flynn, Jackie Gleason, Luke Gordon and Ed Sullivan.Since the late days of the film industry, celluloid representations of Irish Americans have been plentiful. Famous films with Irish-American themes include social dramas such as Little Nellie Kelly and The Cardinal, labor epics like On the Waterfront, and gangster movies such as Angels with Dirty Faces, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, and The Departed. Irish-American characters have been featured in popular television series such as Ryan's Hope, Rescue Me and Blue Bloods.Prominent Irish-American literary figures include Pulitzer and Nobel Prize\u2013winning playwright Eugene O'Neill, Jazz Age novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, author and poet Edgar Allan Poe,[287] social realist James T. Farrell, Southern Gothic writer Flannery O'Connor and Cormac McCarthy. The 19th-century novelist Henry James was also of partly Irish descent. While Irish Americans have been underrepresented in the plastic arts, two well-known American painters claim Irish roots. 20th-century painter Georgia O'Keeffe was born to an Irish-American father, and 19th-century trompe-l'\u0153il painter William Harnett emigrated from Ireland to the United States.The Irish-American contribution to politics spans the entire ideological spectrum. Two prominent American socialists, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, were Irish Americans. In the 1960s, Irish-American writer Michael Harrington became an influential advocate of social welfare programs. Harrington's views profoundly influenced President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert F. Kennedy. Meanwhile, Irish-American political writer William F. Buckley emerged as a major intellectual force in American conservative politics in the latter half of the 20th century. Buckley's magazine, National Review, proved an effective advocate of successful Republican candidates such as Ronald Reagan.Notorious Irish Americans include the legendary New Mexico outlaw Billy the Kid.[288][289] Many historians believe he was born in New York City to Famine-era immigrants from Ireland.[288][289] Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary, was an Irish immigrant, as was madam Josephine Airey, who also went by the name of \"Chicago Joe\" Hensley. New Orleans socialite and murderer Delphine LaLaurie, whose maiden name was Macarty, was of partial paternal Irish ancestry. Irish-American mobsters include, amongst others, Dean O'Banion, Jack \"Legs\" Diamond, Buddy McLean, Howie Winter and Whitey Bulger. Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of John F. Kennedy, had an Irish-born great-grandmother by the name of Mary Tonry.[290] Colorful Irish Americans also include Margaret Tobin of RMS Titanic fame, scandalous model Evelyn Nesbit, dancer Isadora Duncan, San Francisco madam Tessie Wall, and Nellie Cashman, nurse and gold prospector in the American West.The wide popularity of Celtic music has fostered the rise of Irish-American bands that draw heavily on traditional Irish themes and music. Such groups include New York City's Black 47, founded in the late 1980s, blending punk rock, rock and roll, Irish music, rap/hip-hop, reggae, and soul; and the Dropkick Murphys, a Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts, nearly a decade later. The Decemberists, a band featuring Irish-American singer Colin Meloy, released \"Shankill Butchers\", a song that deals with the Ulster Loyalist gang of the same name. The song appears on their album The Crane Wife. Flogging Molly, led by Dublin-born Dave King, are relative newcomers building upon this new tradition.Irish immigrants brought many traditional Irish recipes with them when they emigrated to the United States, which they adapted to meet the different ingredients available to them there. Irish Americans introduced foods like soda bread and colcannon to American cuisine.[291] The famous Irish American meal of corned beef and cabbage was developed by Irish immigrants in the U.S., who adapted it from the traditional Irish recipe for bacon and cabbage.[292] Irish beer such as Guinness is widely consumed in the United States, including an estimated 13 million pints on Saint Patrick's Day alone.[293]Starting with the sons of the famine generation, the Irish dominated baseball and boxing, and played a major role in other sports.Famous in their day were NFL quarterbacks and Super Bowl champions John Elway and Tom Brady, NBA forward Rick Barry,[294] tennis greats Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe, baseball pitcher Nolan Ryan, baseball shortstop Derek Jeter, basketball point guard Jason Kidd, boxing legend Jack Dempsey and Muhammad Ali,[295] world champion pro surfer Kelly Slater, national champion skier Ryan Max Riley, and legendary golfer Ben Hogan.The Irish dominated professional baseball in the late 19th century, making up a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers.  The professional teams played in northeastern cities with large Irish populations that provided a fan base, as well as training for ambitious youth.[296] Casway argues that:Baseball for Irish kids was a shortcut to the American dream and to self-indulgent glory and fortune. By the mid-1880s these young Irish men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed heady, daring, and spontaneous.... Ed Delahanty personified the flamboyant, exciting spectator-favorite, the Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger. The handsome masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played.[297]Irish stars included Charles Comiskey, Connie Mack, Michael \"King\" Kelly, Roger Connor, Eddie Collins, Roger Bresnahan, Ed Walsh and New York Giants manager John McGraw. The large 1945 class of inductees enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown included nine Irish Americans.The Philadelphia Phillies always play at home during spring training on St. Patrick's Day. The Phillies hold the distinction of being the first baseball team to wear green uniforms on St. Patricks Day. The tradition was started by Phillies pitcher Tug McGraw, who dyed his uniform green the night before March 17, 1981.[298]John L. Sullivan  (1858\u20131918), The heavyweight boxing champion, was the first of the modern sports superstars, winning scores of contests \u2013 perhaps as many as 200\u2014with a purse that reached the fabulous sum of one million dollars.[299][300]The Irish brought their native games of handball, hurling and Gaelic football to America. Along with camogie, these sports are part of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The North American GAA organization is still strong, with 128 clubs across its ten divisions.[301]Irish Americans have been prominent in comedy. Notable comedians of Irish descent include Jimmy Dore Jackie Gleason, George Carlin, Bill Burr, Bill Murray, Will Ferrell, Bryan Callen, Pete Holmes, Joe Rogan, Ben Stiller, Chris Farley, Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien, Denis Leary (holds dual American and Irish citizenship),[304] Colin Quinn, Charles Nelson Reilly, Bill Maher, Molly Shannon, John Mulaney, Kathleen Madigan, Jimmy Fallon, Des Bishop, and Jim Gaffigan, among others.Musicians of Irish descent include Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Kurt Cobain, Bing Crosby, Tori Kelly, Tim McGraw, Mandy Moore, Hilary Duff, Fergie, Jerry Garcia, Judy Garland, Katy Perry, Tom Petty, Pink, Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Bruce Springsteen, Gwen Stefani, Lindsay Lohan, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, Prodigy, Post Malone, Trippie Redd and others.Fictional Irish Americans:\nIn the Comic Strips:Many people of Irish descent retain a sense of their Irish heritage. Article 2 of the Constitution of Ireland formally recognizes and embraces this fact:...the Irish Nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.Irish independence from the United Kingdom encouraged the hope that descendants of Irish abroad who had retained a cultural connection and identified with Ireland would resettle there, as opposed to attracting immigrants from other cultures in other countries. One member of an Irish government of the Irish Free State expressed his hope as follows:I do not think [the Irish Free State] will afford sufficient allurements to the citizens of other States ... The children of Irish parents born abroad are sometimes more Irish than the Irish themselves, and they would come with added experience and knowledge to our country....|4=Sen. Patrick Kenny, Seanad \u00c9ireann 1924,\u00a0[306]A sense of exile, diaspora, and (in the case of songs) even nostalgia is a common theme.[307][308] The modern term \"Plastic Paddy\" generally refers to someone who was not born in Ireland and is separated from his closest Irish-born ancestor by several generations but still considers themselves \"Irish\". It is occasionally used in a derogatory fashion towards Irish Americans, in an attempt to cast doubt the \"Irishness\" of the Irish diaspora based on nationality and (citizenship) rather than ethnicity.[309][310][311] The term is freely applied to relevant people of all nationalities, not solely Irish Americans.Some Irish Americans were enthusiastic supporters of Irish independence; the Fenian Brotherhood movement was based in the United States and in the late 1860s launched several unsuccessful attacks on British-controlled Canada known as the \"Fenian Raids\".[312] The Provisional IRA received significant funding and volunteers for its paramilitary activities from Irish expatriates and Irish American supporters\u2014in 1984, the US Department of Justice won a court case forcing the Irish American fund-raising organization NORAID to acknowledge the Provisional IRA as its \"foreign principal\".[313]The vast majority of Irish Catholic Americans settled in large and small cities across the North, particularly railroad centers and mill towns. They became perhaps the most urbanized group in America, as few became farmers.[314] Areas that retain a significant Irish American population include the metropolitan areas of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Providence, Hartford, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Albany, Syracuse, Baltimore, St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, Savannah, and Los Angeles, where most new arrivals of the 1830\u20131910 period settled. As a percentage of the population, Massachusetts is the most Irish state, with about a fifth, 21.2%,  of the population claiming Irish descent.[315]The most Irish American towns in the United States are Scituate, Massachusetts, with 47.5% of its residents being of Irish descent; Milton, Massachusetts, with 44.6% of its 26,000 being of Irish descent; and Braintree, Massachusetts, with 46.5% of its 34,000 being of Irish descent. (Weymouth, Massachusetts, at 39% of its 54,000 citizens, and Quincy, Massachusetts, at 34% of its population of 90,000, are the two most Irish cities in the country. Squantum, a peninsula in the northern part of Quincy, is the most Irish neighborhood in the country, with close to 60% of its 2600 residents claiming Irish descent.)[316]Philadelphia, Boston, New York, and Chicago have historically had neighborhoods with higher percentages of Irish American residents. Regionally, the most Irish American states are Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey in 2013.[317] In consequence of its unique history as a mining center, Butte, Montana, is also one of the country's most thoroughly Irish American cities.[318] Smaller towns, such as Greeley, Nebraska (population 466), with an estimated 51.7% of the residents identifying as Irish American as of 2009\u201313[319][320] were part of the Irish Catholic Colonization effort of Bishop O'Connor of New York in the 1880s.[321]The states with the top percentages of Irish:According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the city of Butte, Montana has the highest percentage of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States, with around one-quarter of the population reporting Irish ancestry.[322][323] Butte's Irish Catholic population originated with the waves of Irish immigrants who arrived in the city in the late-nineteenth century to work in the industrial mines. By population Boston and Philadelphia have the two largest Irish American populations in the country.There are Irish neighborhoods scattered all throughout Boston, most notably South Boston. Many of Philadelphia's Irish neighborhoods are located in the Northeast Philadelphia section of the city, particularly in the Fishtown, Mayfair, and Kensington neighborhoods, as well as the South Philadelphia section, most notably the Pennsport (\"Two Street\" to the locals)  neighborhood. There are large Irish populations in the Boston and Philadelphia metropolitan areas as well. The South Side of Chicago, Illinois also has a large Irish community, who refer to themselves as the South Side Irish.The United States Declaration of Independence contained 56 delegate signatures. Of the signers, eight were of Irish descent. Three signers, Matthew Thornton, George Taylor and James Smith, were born in Ireland; the remaining five Irish Americans, George Read, Thomas McKean, Thomas Lynch Jr., Edward Rutledge, and Charles Carroll, were the sons or grandsons of Irish immigrants. Though not a delegate but the secretary at the Congress, Charles Thomson, also Irish American, signed as well. The United States Constitution was created by a convention of 36 delegates. Of these, at least six were of Irish ancestry. George Read and Thomas McKean had already worked on the Declaration, and were joined by John Rutledge, William Paterson, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, and Thomas Fitzsimons. The Carrolls and Fitzsimons were Irish Catholic, while Thomas Lynch Jr, James Smith, Pierce Butler and George Read were Irish Protestants they were descended from Irish Normans Anglo-Irish and native Irish who had intermarried for several centuries not ulster-Scots.  The remainder were Scotch-Irish.[324][325]By the 1850s, the Irish were already a major presence in the police departments of large cities. In New York City in 1855, of the city's 1,149 policemen, 305 were natives of Ireland. Within 30 years, Irish Americans in the NYPD were almost twice their proportion of the city's population.[120] Both Boston's police and fire departments provided many Irish immigrants with their first jobs. The creation of a unified police force in Philadelphia opened the door to the Irish in that city. By 1860 in Chicago, 49 of the 107 on the police force were Irish. Chief O'Leary headed the police force in New Orleans, and Malachi Fallon was chief of police of San Francisco.[326]The Irish Catholic diaspora are very well-organized[clarification needed] and since 1850 have produced a majority of the leaders of the U.S. Catholic Church, labor unions, the Democratic Party in larger cities, and Catholic high schools, colleges and universities.[327]The cities of Milwaukee (Tom Barrett; 2004-) and Detroit (Mike Duggan; 2012-) currently (as of 2018[update]) have Irish American mayors. Pittsburgh mayor Bob O'Connor died in office in 2006. New York City has had at least three Irish-born mayors and over eight Irish American mayors. The most recent one was County Mayo native William O'Dwyer, first elected in 1945.[328][329] Beginning in the 1909 mayoral election, every Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City was a man of Irish descent until 1950, when a special election saw three Italian Americans as the top vote getters.[330]The Irish Protestant vote has not been studied nearly as much. Historian Timothy J. Meagher argues that by the late 19th century, most of the Protestant Irish \"turned their backs on all associations with Ireland and melted into the American Protestant mainstream.\" A minority insisted on a \"Scots-Irish\" identity.[331]In Canada, by contrast, Irish Protestants remained a political force, with many belonging to the Orange Order.[332] It was an anti-Catholic social organization with chapters across Canada. It was most powerful during the late 19th century.[333][334]Al Smith and later John F. Kennedy were political heroes for American Catholics.[335] Al Smith, who had an Irish mother and an Italian-German father, in 1928 became the first Catholic to run for president.[336] From the 1830s to the 1960s, Irish Catholics voted heavily Democratic, with occasional exceptions like the 1920 United States presidential election. Their precincts showed average support levels of 80%.[337] As historian Lawrence McCaffrey notes, \"until recently they have been so closely associated with the Democratic party that Irish, Catholic, and Democrat composed a trinity of associations, serving mutual interests and needs. \"[338]The great majority of Irish Catholic politicians were Democrats, with a few exceptions before 1970 such as Connecticut Senator John A. Danaher and Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy.[324] Today, Irish politicians are associated with both parties. Ronald Reagan boasted of his Irishness. Historically, Irish Catholics controlled prominent Democratic city organizations.[339] Among the most prominent were  New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Jersey City, and Albany.[340] Many served as chairmen of the Democratic National Committee, including County Monaghan native Thomas Taggart, Vance McCormick, James Farley, Edward J. Flynn, Robert E. Hannegan, J. Howard McGrath, William H. Boyle, Jr., John Moran Bailey, Larry O'Brien, Christopher J. Dodd, Terry McAuliffe and Tim Kaine. In Congress, the Irish are represented in both parties; currently, Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, Jr. of Pennsylvania, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and Maria Cantwell of Washington are Irish Americans serving in the United States Senate. Former Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan is another prominent Irish-American Republican. Exit polls show that in recent presidential elections Irish Catholics have split about 50\u201350 for Democratic and Republican candidates.[341] The pro-life faction in the Democratic party includes many Irish Catholic politicians, such as the former Boston mayor and ambassador to the Vatican Ray Flynn and senator Bob Casey, Jr., who defeated Senator Rick Santorum in a high visibility race in Pennsylvania in 2006.[342]In New York State where fusion voting is practiced, Irish Americans were instrumental in the founding of the Conservative party in opposition to Nelson Rockefeller and other liberal Republicans who dominated the state GOP during the 1960s and 70s.[343] The party, founded by Irish American lawyers J. Daniel Mahoney and Kieran O'Doherty would serve as a vehicle for William F. Buckley when he ran for mayor of New York in 1965 against liberal WASP Republican John V. Lindsay and establishment Democrat Abe Beame.  Elsewhere, significant majorities of the local Irish stayed with the Democratic party, such as in Massachusetts and in other parts of Southern New England.[344]In some heavily Irish small towns in northern New England and central New Jersey the Irish vote is quite Republican, but other places like Gloucester, New Jersey and Butte, Montana retain strongly liberal and Democratic-leaning Irish populations.  In the 1984 United States Presidential Election Irish Catholics in Massachusetts voted 56% to 43% for Walter Mondale while their cousins in New York State voted 68% to 32% for Ronald Reagan.[345]The voting intentions of Irish Americans and other white ethnic groups attracted attention in the 2016 US election. In the Democratic primaries, Boston's Irish were said to break strongly for Hillary Clinton, whose victories in Irish-heavy Boston suburbs may have helped her narrowly carry the state over Bernie Sanders.[346] A 2016 March survey by Irish Central [347] showed that 45% of Irish Americans nationwide supported Donald Trump, although the majority of those in Massachusetts supported Hillary Clinton. An October poll by Buzzfeed showed that Irish respondents nationwide split nearly evenly between Trump (40%) and Clinton (39%), with large numbers either undecided or supporting other candidates (21%), and that the Irish were more supportive of Clinton than all the other West European-descended Americans including fellow Catholic Italian Americans.[348]In early November 2016, six days before the election, another poll by IrishCentral showed Clinton ahead at 52% among Irish Americans, while Trump was at 40% and the third-party candidates together had 8%; Irish respondents in Massachusetts similarly favored Clinton by majority.[349] In 2017, a survey with 3,181 Irish American respondents (slightly over half being beyond 3rd generation) by Irish Times found that 41% identified as Democrats while 23% identified as Republicans; moreover, 45% used NBC (typically considered left-leaning) for their news while 36% used Fox News (considered right-leaning).[350]The presence of supporters of Trump among Irish and other white ethnic communities which had once themselves been marginalized immigrants generated controversy, with progressive Irish American media figures admonishing their co-ethnics against \"myopia\" and \"amnesia\".[351] However, such criticisms by left leaning pundits were frequently leveled against Irish-American conservatives prior to Trump's presidential run, with one columnist from the liberal online magazine Salon calling Irish-American conservatives \"disgusting\".[352] In New York City, ongoing trends of suburbanization, gentrification, and the increased tendency of Irish-Americans to vote Republican, as well as the increasingly left wing politics of the Democrat Party, led to the collapse of Irish political power in the city during the 2010s.[353] This trend was exemplified by the defeat of Queens Representative and former House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley by democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2018 Democratic primary.[354][355]A large number of the presidents of the United States have Irish origins.[356] The extent of Irish heritage varies. For example, Chester Arthur's father and both of Andrew Jackson's parents were Irish-born of British ancestry, while George W. Bush has distant Irish ancestry. Ronald Reagan's father was of Irish ancestry,[357] while his mother also had some Irish ancestors. John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden had Irish lineage on both sides. Within this group, only Kennedy and Biden were raised as practicing Roman Catholics. Barack Obama's Irish heritage originates from his Kansas-born mother, Ann Dunham, whose ancestry is Irish and English.[358]17th president, 1865\u201369: Although he was Protestant, he had native Irish ancestry on his mother's side. His Mother was Mary \"Polly\" McDonough of Irish ancestry 1782[359]27th president 1909\u201313: His great great great grandfather, Robert Taft was born in 1640 in Ireland and immigrated to America, during the mid 17th century. Robert Taft was from County Louth in the republic of Ireland, his ancestry was both native Irish and Anglo-Irish[360][361]28th president 1913-1921: His paternal grandfather, an Ulster Protestant, immigrated from Strabane, County Tyrone, in 1807.22nd and 24th president, 1885\u201389 and 1893\u201397: although personally Protestant, Cleveland had native Ulster Irish ancestry. He was the maternal grandson of merchant Abner O'Neal, who emigrated from County Antrim in the 1790s[362]18th president, 1869\u201377: His grandmother was Rachel Kelley, the daughter of an Irish pioneer[363] Surname Kelly within Ulster is almost entirely of Irish origin[364]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Family_therapist": "Family therapy (also referred to as family counseling, family systems therapy, marriage and family therapy, couple and family therapy) is a branch of psychology that works with families and couples in intimate relationships to nurture change and development. It tends to view change in terms of the systems of interaction between family members.The different schools of family therapy have in common a belief that, regardless of the origin of the problem, and regardless of whether the clients consider it an \"individual\" or \"family\" issue, involving families in solutions often benefits clients. This involvement of families is commonly accomplished by their direct participation in the therapy session. The skills of the family therapist thus include the ability to influence conversations in a way that catalyses the strengths, wisdom, and support of the wider system.[1]In the field's early years, many clinicians defined the family in a narrow, traditional manner usually including parents and children. As the field has evolved, the concept of the family is more commonly defined in terms of strongly supportive, long-term roles and relationships between people who may or may not be related by blood or marriage.The conceptual frameworks developed by family therapists, especially those of\nfamily systems theorists, have been applied to a wide range of human behavior, including organisational dynamics and the study of greatness.Formal interventions with families to help individuals and families experiencing various kinds of problems have been a part of many cultures, probably throughout history. These interventions have sometimes involved formal procedures or rituals, and often included the extended family as well as non-kin members of the community (see for example Ho'oponopono). Following the emergence of specialization in various societies, these interventions were often conducted by particular members of a community \u2013 for example, a chief, priest, physician, and so on - usually as an ancillary function.[2]Family therapy as a distinct professional practice within Western cultures can be argued to have had its origins in the social work movements of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and the United States.[2] As a branch of psychotherapy, its roots can be traced somewhat later to the early 20th century with the emergence of the child guidance movement and marriage counseling.[3] The formal development of family therapy dates from the 1940s and early 1950s with the founding in 1942 of the American Association of Marriage Counselors (the precursor of the AAMFT), and through the work of various independent clinicians and groups - in the United Kingdom (John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic), the United States (Donald deAvila Jackson, John Elderkin Bell, Nathan Ackerman, Christian Midelfort, Theodore Lidz, Lyman Wynne, Murray Bowen, Carl Whitaker, Virginia Satir, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy), and in Hungary, D.L.P. Liebermann - who began seeing family members together for observation or therapy sessions.[2][4] There was initially a strong influence from psychoanalysis (most of the early founders of the field had psychoanalytic backgrounds) and social psychiatry, and later from learning theory and behavior therapy - and significantly, these clinicians began to articulate various theories about the nature and functioning of the family as an entity that was more than a mere aggregation of individuals.[3]The movement received an important boost starting in the early 1950s through the work of anthropologist Gregory Bateson and colleagues \u2013 Jay Haley, Donald D. Jackson, John Weakland, William Fry, and later, Virginia Satir, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, Paul Watzlawick and others \u2013 at Palo Alto in the United States, who introduced ideas from cybernetics and general systems theory into social psychology and psychotherapy, focusing in particular on the role of communication (see Bateson Project). This approach eschewed the traditional focus on individual psychology and historical factors \u2013 that involve so-called linear causation and content \u2013 and emphasized instead feedback and homeostatic  mechanisms and \u201crules\u201d in here-and-now interactions \u2013 so-called circular causation and process \u2013 that were thought to maintain or exacerbate problems, whatever the original cause(s).[5][6] (See also systems psychology and systemic therapy.)  This group was also influenced significantly by the work of US psychiatrist, hypnotherapist, and brief therapist, Milton H. Erickson - especially his innovative use of strategies for change, such as paradoxical directives (see also Reverse psychology). The members of the Bateson Project (like the founders of a number of other schools of family therapy, including Carl Whitaker, Murray Bowen, and Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy) had a particular interest in the possible psychosocial causes and treatment of schizophrenia, especially in terms of the putative \"meaning\" and \"function\" of signs and symptoms within the family system. The research of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts Lyman Wynne and Theodore Lidz on communication deviance and roles (e.g., pseudo-mutuality, pseudo-hostility, schism and skew) in families of people with schizophrenia also became influential with systems-communications-oriented theorists and therapists.[3][7] A related theme, applying to dysfunction and psychopathology more generally, was that of the \"identified patient\" or \"presenting problem\" as a manifestation of or surrogate for the family's, or even society's, problems. (See also double bind; family nexus.)By the mid-1960s, a number of distinct schools of family therapy had emerged. From those groups that were most strongly influenced by cybernetics and systems theory, there came MRI Brief Therapy, and slightly later, strategic therapy, Salvador Minuchin's Structural Family Therapy and the Milan systems model. Partly in reaction to some aspects of these systemic models, came the experiential approaches of Virginia Satir and Carl Whitaker, which downplayed theoretical constructs, and emphasized subjective experience and unexpressed feelings (including the subconscious), authentic communication, spontaneity, creativity, total therapist engagement, and often included the extended family. Concurrently and somewhat independently, there emerged the various intergenerational therapies of Murray Bowen, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, James Framo, and Norman Paul, which present different theories about the intergenerational transmission of health and dysfunction, but which all deal usually with at least three generations of a family (in person or conceptually), either directly in therapy sessions, or via \"homework\", \"journeys home\", etc. Psychodynamic family therapy - which, more than any other school of family therapy, deals directly with individual psychology and the unconscious in the context of current relationships - continued to develop through a number of groups that were influenced by the ideas and methods of Nathan Ackerman, and also by the British School of Object Relations and John Bowlby\u2019s work on attachment. Multiple-family group therapy, a precursor of psychoeducational family intervention, emerged, in part, as a pragmatic alternative form of intervention - especially as an adjunct to the treatment of serious mental disorders with a significant biological basis, such as schizophrenia - and represented something of a conceptual challenge to some of the \"systemic\" (and thus potentially \"family-blaming\") paradigms of pathogenesis that were implicit in many of the dominant models of family therapy. The late-1960s and early-1970s saw the development of network therapy (which bears some resemblance to traditional practices such as Ho'oponopono) by Ross Speck and Carolyn Attneave, and the emergence of behavioral marital therapy (renamed behavioral couples therapy in the 1990s; see also relationship counseling) and behavioral family therapy as models in their own right.[3]By the late-1970s, the weight of clinical experience - especially in relation to the treatment of serious mental disorders - had led to some revision of a number of the original models and a moderation of some of the earlier stridency and theoretical purism. There were the beginnings of a general softening of the strict demarcations between schools, with moves toward rapprochement, integration, and eclecticism \u2013 although there was, nevertheless, some hardening of positions within some schools. These trends were reflected in and influenced by lively debates within the field and critiques from various sources, including feminism and post-modernism, that reflected in part the cultural and political tenor of the times, and which foreshadowed the emergence (in the 1980s and 1990s) of the various \"post-systems\" constructivist and social constructionist approaches. While there was still debate within the field about whether, or to what degree, the systemic-constructivist and medical-biological paradigms were necessarily antithetical to each other (see also Anti-psychiatry; Biopsychosocial model), there was a growing willingness and tendency on the part of family therapists to work in multi-modal clinical partnerships with other members of the helping and medical professions.[3][7][8]From the mid-1980s to the present, the field has been marked by a diversity of approaches that partly reflect the original schools, but which also draw on other theories and methods from individual psychotherapy and elsewhere \u2013 these approaches and sources include: brief therapy, structural therapy, constructivist approaches (e.g., Milan systems, post-Milan/collaborative/conversational, reflective), Bring forthism approach (e.g. Dr. Karl Tomm's IPscope model and Interventive interviewing), solution-focused therapy, narrative therapy, a range of cognitive and behavioral approaches, psychodynamic and object relations approaches, attachment and emotionally focused therapy, intergenerational approaches, network therapy, and multisystemic therapy (MST).[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Multicultural, intercultural, and integrative approaches are being developed, with Vincenzo Di Nicola weaving a synthesis of family therapy and transcultural psychiatry in his model of cultural family therapy, A Stranger in the Family: Culture, Families, and Therapy.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] Many practitioners claim to be \"eclectic\", using techniques from several areas, depending upon their own inclinations and/or the needs of the client(s), and there is a growing movement toward a single \u201cgeneric\u201d family therapy that seeks to incorporate the best of the accumulated knowledge in the field and which can be adapted to many different contexts;[28] however, there are still a significant number of therapists who adhere more or less strictly to a particular, or limited number of, approach(es).[29]The Liberation Based Healing framework for family therapy offers a complete paradigm shift for working with families while addressing the intersections of race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation and other socio-political identity markers.[30] This theoretical approach and praxis is informed by Critical Pedagogy, Feminism, Critical Race Theory, and Decolonizing Theory.[31]  This framework necessitates an understanding of the ways Colonization, Cis-Heteronormativity, Patriarchy, White Supremacy and other systems of domination impact individuals, families and communities and centers the need to disrupt the status quo in how power operates. Traditional Western models of family therapy have historically ignored these dimensions and when white, male privilege has been critiqued, largely by feminist theory practitioners, it has often been to the benefit of middle class, white women's experiences.[32]  While an understanding of intersectionality is of particular significance in working with families with violence, a liberatory framework examines how power, privilege and oppression operate within and across all relationships. Liberatory practices are based on the principles of Critical-Consciousness, Accountability and Empowerment. These principles guide not only the content of the therapeutic work with clients but also the supervisory and training process of therapists.[31] Dr. Rhea Almeida, developed the Cultural Context Model as a way to operationalize these concepts into practice through the integration of culture circles, sponsors, and a socio-educational process within the therapeutic work.[33]Ideas and methods from family therapy have been influential in psychotherapy generally: a survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed that of the 10 most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century, three were prominent family therapists and that the marital and family systems model was the second most utilized model after cognitive behavioral therapy.[34]Family therapy uses a range of counseling and other techniques including:The number of sessions depends on the situation, but the average is 5-20 sessions. A family therapist usually meets several members of the family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.The distinctive feature of family therapy is its perspective and analytical framework rather than the number of people present at a therapy session.  Specifically, family therapists are relational therapists:  They are generally more interested in what goes on between individuals rather than within one or more individuals, although some family therapists\u2014in particular those who identify as psychodynamic, object relations, intergenerational, or experiential family therapists (EFTs)\u2014tend to be as interested in individuals as in the systems those individuals and their relationships constitute.  Depending on the conflicts at issue and the progress of therapy to date, a therapist may focus on analyzing specific previous instances of conflict, as by reviewing a past incident and suggesting alternative ways family members might have responded to one another during it, or instead proceed directly to addressing the sources of conflict at a more abstract level, as by pointing out patterns of interaction that the family might have not noticed.Family therapists tend to be more interested in the maintenance and/or solving of problems rather than in trying to identify a single cause.  Some families may perceive cause-effect analyses as attempts to allocate blame to one or more individuals, with the effect that for many families a focus on causation is of little or no clinical utility. It is important to note that a circular way of problem evaluation is used as opposed to a linear route. Using this method, families can be helped by finding patterns of behaviour, what the causes are, and what can be done to better their situation.[35]Family therapy has an evolving evidence base. A summary of current evidence is available via the UK's Association of Family Therapy.[36] Evaluation and outcome studies can also be found on the Family Therapy and Systemic Research Centre website. The website also includes quantitative and qualitative research studies of many aspects of family therapy.[37]According to a 2004 French government study conducted by French Institute of Health and Medical Research, family and couples therapy was the second most effective therapy after Cognitive behavioral therapy.[38] The study used meta-analysis of over a hundred secondary studies to find some level of effectiveness that was either \"proven\" or \"presumed\" to exist. Of the treatments studied, family therapy was presumed or proven effective at treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anorexia and alcohol dependency.[38]In a 1999 address to the Coalition of Marriage, Family and Couples Education conference in Washington, D.C., University of Minnesota Professor William Doherty said:I take no joy in being a whistle blower, but it's time. I am a committed marriage and family therapist, having practiced this form of therapy since 1977. I train marriage and family therapists. I believe that marriage therapy can be very helpful in the hands of therapists who are committed to the profession and the practice. But there are a lot of problems out there with the practice of therapy - a lot of problems.[39]Doherty suggested questions prospective clients should ask a therapist before beginning treatment:[39]Family therapy practitioners come from a range of professional backgrounds, and some are specifically qualified or licensed/registered in family therapy (licensing is not required in some jurisdictions and requirements vary from place to place). In the United Kingdom, family therapists will have a prior relevant professional training in one of the helping professions usually psychologists, psychotherapists, or counselors who have done further training in family therapy, either a diploma or an M.Sc. In the United States there is a specific degree and license as a marriage and family therapist; however, psychologists, nurses, psychotherapists, social workers, or counselors, and other licensed mental health professionals may practice family therapy. In the UK, family therapists who have completed a four-year qualifying programme of study (MSc) are eligible to register with the professional body the Association of Family Therapy (AFT), and with the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP).A master's degree is required to work as a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) in some American states. Most commonly, MFTs will first earn a M.S. or M.A. degree in marriage and family therapy, counseling, psychology, family studies, or social work. After graduation, prospective MFTs work as interns under the supervision of a licensed professional and are referred to as an MFTi.[40][unreliable medical source?]Prior to 1999 in California, counselors who specialized in this area were called Marriage, Family and Child Counselors. Today, they are known as Marriage and Family Therapists (MFT), and work variously in private practice, in clinical settings such as hospitals, institutions, or counseling organizations.Marriage and family therapists in the United States and Canada often seek degrees from accredited Masters or Doctoral programs recognized by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), a division of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy.Requirements vary, but in most states about 3000 hours of supervised work as an intern are needed to sit for a licensing exam. MFTs must be licensed by the state to practice. Only after completing their education and internship and passing the state licensing exam can a person call themselves a Marital and Family Therapist and work unsupervised.License restrictions can vary considerably from state to state.  Contact information about licensing boards in the United States are provided by the Association of Marital and Family Regulatory Boards.There have been concerns raised within the profession about the fact that specialist training in couples therapy \u2013 as distinct from family therapy in general - is not required to gain a license as an MFT or membership of the main professional body, the AAMFT.[41]Since issues of interpersonal conflict, power, control, values, and ethics are often more pronounced in relationship therapy than in individual therapy, there has been debate within the profession about the different values that are implicit in the various theoretical models of therapy and the role of the therapist's own values in the therapeutic process, and how prospective clients should best go about finding a therapist whose values and objectives are most consistent with their own. An early paper on ethics in family therapy written by Vincenzo Di Nicola in consultation with a bioethicist asked basic questions about whether strategic interventions \"mean what they say\" and if it is ethical to invent opinions offered to families about the treatment process, such as statements saying that half of the treatment team believes one thing and half believes another.[42][43][44][45] Specific issues that have emerged have included an increasing questioning of the longstanding notion of therapeutic neutrality,[46][47][48] a concern with questions of justice and self-determination,[49] connectedness and independence,[50] \"functioning\" versus \"authenticity\",[8] and questions about the degree of the therapist's \"pro-marriage/family\" versus \"pro-individual\" commitment.[51]The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy requires members to adhere to a \"Code of Ethics\", including a commitment to \"continue therapeutic relationships only so long as it is reasonably clear that clients are benefiting from the relationship.\"[52]Some key developers of family therapy are:(references:[54][55][56][57])Key influences: Celia Falicov, Antonio Ferreira, James Framo, Edwin Friedman, Mara Selvini Palazzoli,  Carlos Sluzki, Victor Turner, Michael White",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Kindergarten": "Kindergarten[a] is a preschool educational approach based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Such institutions were originally made in the late 18th century in Bavaria and Alsace to serve children whose parents both worked outside home. The term was coined by the German Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of educational institutions and learning spaces for children ranging from 2 to 6 years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods.In 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strasbourg an early establishment for caring for and educating preschool children whose parents were absent during the day.[2] At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were created in Bavaria.[3] In 1802, Princess Pauline zur Lippe established a preschool center in Detmold, the capital of the then principality of Lippe, Germany (now in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia).[4]In 1816, Robert Owen, a philosopher and pedagogue, opened the first British and probably globally the first infants school in New Lanark, Scotland.[5][6][7] In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.[8]Samuel Wilderspin opened his first infant school in London in 1819,[9] and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the playground. In 1823, Wilderspin published On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor, based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age.Countess Theresa Brunszvik (1775\u20131861), who had known and been influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, was influenced by this example to open an Angyalkert (\"angel garden\" in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828, in her residence in Buda, the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children.[10][11] In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the Kingdom of Hungary.Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel (1782\u20131852) opened a \"play and activity\" institute in 1837 in the village of Bad Blankenburg in the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Thuringia, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute Kindergarten (meaning garden of children)[12] on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished \"like plants in a garden\".[13] Fr\u00f6bel introduced an educational environment into his school, in contrast to other earlier infant establishments, and is therefore credited with the creation of kindergartens.[14][15] Around 1873, Caroline Wiseneder's method for teaching instrumental music to young children was adopted by the national kindergarten movement in Germany.[16]Women trained by Fr\u00f6bel opened kindergartens throughout Europe and around the world. The first kindergarten in the US was founded in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856, and was conducted in German by Margaretha Meyer-Schurz.[17]Elizabeth Peabody founded the first English-language kindergarten in the US in 1860.[18] The first free kindergarten in the US was founded in 1870 by Conrad Poppenhusen, a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the Poppenhusen Institute. The first publicly financed kindergarten in the US was established in St. Louis in 1873 by Susan Blow.Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 1870. By the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities.[19][20] In 1882, The country's first public-school kindergartens were established in Berlin, Ontario (modern Kitchener) at the Central School.[21] In 1885, the Toronto Normal School (teacher training) opened a department for kindergarten teaching.[21]The Australian kindergarten movement emerged in the last decade of the nineteenth century as both a philanthropic and educational endeavour. The first free kindergarten in Australia was established in 1896 in Sydney, New South Wales, by the Kindergarten Union of NSW (now KU Children's Services) led by reformer Maybanke Anderson.[22][23]American educator Elizabeth Harrison wrote extensively on the theory of early childhood education and worked to enhance educational standards for kindergarten teachers by establishing what became the National College of Education in 1886.In Afghanistan, children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend kindergartens (Dari: \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646; Pashto: \u0648\u0693\u06a9\u062a\u0648\u0646). Although kindergartens in Afghanistan are not part of the school system, they are often run by the government.Early childhood development programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan[what language is this?]. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, peaking in 1990 with more than 270 in Afghanistan. At its peak, there were 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children in the country. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, these early childhood development programs provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/preschool centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,[citation needed] at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.[citation needed]In each state of Australia, kindergarten (frequently referred to as kinder or kindy) means something slightly different. In Tasmania, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it is the first year of primary school. In Victoria, kindergarten is a form of preschool and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria and Tasmania, the phrase for the first year of primary school is called Prep (short for \"preparatory\"), which is followed by Year 1.In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. As with Victoria and Tasmania, the first year of primary school is also called Prep, which is then followed by Year 1.The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the Northern Territory is referred to respectively as pre-primary, reception or transition.[24] In Western Australia, the year preceding pre-primary is called kindergarten.In Bangladesh, the term kindergarten, or KG school (kindergarten school), is used to refer to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. The names of the levels are nursery, shishu (children), etc. The view of kindergarten education has changed significantly over time. Almost every rural area now has at least one kindergarten school, with most being run in the Bengali language. They also follow the textbooks published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with slight modification, adding some extra books to the syllabus. The grades generally start from nursery (sometimes \"play group\"), \"KG\" afterwards, and end with the 5th grade. Separate from the National Education System, kindergarten contributes greatly toward achieving the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education in Bangladesh.[citation needed]In Brazil, kindergarten (Portuguese: Jardim de Inf\u00e2ncia) is the only non-compulsory education modality, for children up to 4 years old completed after March 31 for the vast majority of states. From the age of 4 completed until March 31, the child is eligible for preschool (Pr\u00e9-Escola), which is mandatory and precedes the 1st grade. When a child turns 6 years old between April 1 and December 31, he/she must be in kindergarten (last grade of preschool nursery school), also known as kindergarten III, also known as \u201c3\u00ba per\u00edodo da Escola Infantil\u201d.In Bulgaria, the term detska gradina (\u0434\u0435\u03c4\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430) refers to the caring and schooling children attend from ages 3 to 7 (in some cases 6). Usually the children attend the detska gradina from morning until late afternoon when their parents return from work. Most Bulgarian kindergartens are public. Since 2012, two years of preschool education are compulsory. These two years of mandatory preschool education may be attended either in kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools.[25]Schools outside of Ontario and the Northwest Territories generally provide one year of kindergarten, except some private schools which offer junior kindergarten (JK) for 4-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as preschool). Kindergarten is mandatory in British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and is optional elsewhere.[26] The province of Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary. After kindergarten, the child begins grade one.The province of Ontario and the Northwest Territories provide two years of kindergarten, usually part of an elementary school. Within the French school system in Ontario, junior kindergarten is called maternelle and senior kindergarten is called jardin d'enfants, which is a calque of the German word Kindergarten.Within the province of Quebec, junior kindergarten is called pr\u00e9maternelle (which is not mandatory), is attended by 4-year-olds, and senior kindergarten (SK) is called maternelle, which is also not mandatory by the age of 5; this class is integrated into primary schools.In Chile, the term equivalent to kindergarten is educaci\u00f3n parvularia, sometimes also called educaci\u00f3n preescolar. It is the first level of the Chilean educational system. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from birth until their entry to the educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica (primary education), without being considered compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or subcategories of levels:In China, preschool education, before the child enters formal schooling at 6 years of age, is generally divided into a \"nursery\" or \"preschool\" stage and a \"kindergarten\" (Chinese: \u5e7c\u513f\u56ed; pinyin: y\u00f2u'\u00e9ryu\u00e1n) stage. These can be two separate institutions, or a single combined one in different areas. Where there are two separate institutions, it is common for the kindergarten to consist of the two upper years, and the preschool to consist of one lower year. Common names for these three years are:In some places, children at 5\u20136 years may in addition or instead attend reception or preparatory classes (Chinese: \u5b66\u524d\u73ed; pinyin: xu\u00e9 qi\u00e1n b\u0101n) focusing on preparing children for formal schooling.State (public) kindergartens only accept children older than 3 years, while private ones do not have such limitations.Kindergarten (b\u00f8rnehave) is a day care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) were made mandatory in 2009 and are offered by primary schools before a child enters first grade.Two-thirds of established day care institutions in Denmark are municipal day care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) forest kindergartens, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.In Egypt, children may go to kindergarten for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.At the end of the 1850s, Uno Cygnaeus, known as the \"father of the Finnish primary school\", presented the idea of bringing kindergartens to Finland after attending a kindergarten in Hamburg and a seminar training kindergarten teachers during his study trip to Central Europe.[28] As early as 1920, there were about 80 kindergartens in operation across Finland, with a total of about 6,000 children.[28]Kindergarten activity emphases and background communities vary. In Finland, most kindergartens are society's service to families while some are private. The underlying philosophy may be Montessori or Waldorf education. Preschools often also operate in connection with Finnish kindergartens. Kindergartens can also arrange language immersion programs in different languages. Finnish kindergartens now have an early childhood education plan, and parenting discussions are held with the parents of each child every year. Among OECD countries, Finland has higher-than-average public funding for early childhood education[29][30] and the highest number of staff for children under the age of 3: only four children per adult.[31]In France, preschool is known as \u00e9cole maternelle (French for \"nursery school\", literally \"maternal school\"). Free maternelle schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from 3 to 5 (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into grande section (GS: 5-year-olds), moyenne section (MS: 4-year-olds), petite section (PS: 3-year-olds) and toute petite section (TPS: 2-year-olds). It became compulsory in 2018 for all children aged 3. Even before the 2018 law, almost all children aged 3 to 5 attended \u00e9cole maternelle.[citation needed] It is regulated by the Ministry of National Education.In Germany, a Kindergarten (masculine: der Kindergarten, plural die Kinderg\u00e4rten) is a facility for the care of preschool children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, Kinderkrippe or Krippe refers to a cr\u00e8che for the care of children before they enter Kindergarten (9 weeks to about three years), while Kindertagesst\u00e4tte\u2014literally \"children's day site\", usually shortened to Kita\u2014is an umbrella term for any day care facility for preschoolers.Attendance is voluntary, and usually not free of charge. Preschool children over the age of one are entitled to receive local and affordable day care.[32] Within the federal system, Kinderg\u00e4rten fall under the responsibility of the states,[33] which usually delegate a large share of the responsibility to the municipalities. Due to the subsidiarity principle stipulated by \u00a74 SGB VIII, there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents' initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many Kinderg\u00e4rten follow a certain educational approach, such as Montessori, Reggio Emilia, \"Berliner Bildungsprogramm\" or Waldorf; forest kindergartens are well established. Most Kinderg\u00e4rten are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.Even in smaller townships, there are often both Roman Catholic and Lutheran kindergartens available. Places in cr\u00e8ches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure and must be reserved in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013.[citation needed] The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin[34] or Hamburg,[35] and poorest in parts of Southern Germany.[36]All caretakers in Kita or Kindergarten must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.Kinderg\u00e4rten can be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. or longer and may also house a cr\u00e8che (Kinderkrippe) for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon Hort (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day care nurses (Tagesm\u00fctter or Tagespflegepersonen) working independently of any preschool institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children, typically up to the age of three. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.The term Vorschule (\"preschool\") is used both for educational efforts in Kinderg\u00e4rten and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each German state. The Schulkindergarten is a type of Vorschule.In Greece, kindergarten is called nipiagogio (\u03bd\u03b7\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf). Kindergarten is a form of preschool and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool.Pre-primary Services in Hong Kong refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.At present, most of the kindergartens operate on a half-day basis offering upper and lower kindergarten and nursery classes. Some kindergartens also operate full-day kindergarten classes. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child's development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed performance indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000/01 school year, quality assurance inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality early childhood education.In Hungary a kindergarten is called an \u00f3voda (\"place for caring\"). Children attend kindergarten between ages 3\u20136/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons.[37] Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign language and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year, children begin preparation for elementary school.Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.In India, there are only informal directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation. Directives state that children who are three years old on 30 September in the given academic year are eligible to attend nursery and kindergarten classes. Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years of their time in pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD[clarification needed] ministry norms. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however, it is preferred. All government schools and affiliated private schools allow children who are 5 years of age to enroll in standard 1 of a primary school. Mid-day meals are provided in most parts of the country and institutes run by the government.In Italy, preschool education refers to two different grades:Italian asilo nido were officially instituted in a 1971 State Law (L. 1044/1971), and may be run by either private or public institutions. They were originally established to allow mothers a chance to work outside of the home, and were therefore seen as a social service. Today, they mostly serve the purpose of general education and social interaction. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children's care: well known is the so-called Reggio Emilia approach, named after the city of Reggio Emilia, in Emilia-Romagna.Asilo nido normally occupy small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; usually suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the asilo nido are the classrooms, split into playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.Maternal schools (scuola materna) were established in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of the official Italian education system, though attendance is not compulsory. Like asilo nido (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers and fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, social skills, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools. Kindergartens (y\u014dchien (\u5e7c\u7a1a\u5712)), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education but are not part of the official education system. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised nursery schools (hoikuen (\u4fdd\u80b2\u5712)), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, nursery schools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll 86% at age 3 and 99% at age 5 prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade.[38] The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.North Korean children attend kindergarten from 4 to 6. Kindergartens have two sections; low class (Korean: \ub0ae\uc740\ubc18 najeun-ban) and high class (Korean: \ub192\uc740\ubc18 nopeun-ban) high class is compulsory.In South Korea, children normally attend kindergarten (Korean: \uc720\uce58\uc6d0 yuchi won) between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean ages are calculated differently from Western ages: one is considered one year old from birth. Additionally, one's age increases by one year on January 1 regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called five-, six- and seven-year-olds). The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis.Korean kindergartens are private schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens to give them a head start in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents send their children to kindergarten.Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of homework. Very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, taekwondo, ballet, soccer or mathematics.In Kuwait, Kuwaiti children may go to free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of three-and-a-half and five.In Luxembourg, kindergarten is called Spillschoul (literally \"Playschool\", plural Spillschoulen). It is a public education facility which is attended by children between the age of 4 (or 5) and 6, when they advance to Grondschoul (elementary school).In Malaysia, kindergarten is known as tadika. Most kindergartens are available to children of ages five and six (and some are available to children as young as four). For children up to the age of three (or four), there are preschool playgroups. There are no fixed rules for when a child needs to go to a kindergarten, but the majority do at 5 years of age. The child will usually attend kindergarten for two years, before proceeding to primary school at age 7.[39]In Mexico, kindergarten is called k\u00ednder, with the last year sometimes referred to as preprimaria (primaria is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means \"prior to elementary school\"). The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor Rosaura Zapata, who received the country's highest honor for her contribution. It consists of three years of preschool education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional and may be offered in either private schools or public schools.At private schools, k\u00ednders usually consist of three grades, and a fourth may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal; it comes prior to the other three years and is not obligatory. While the first grade is a playgroup, the other two are classroom education.In 2002, the Congress of the Union approved the Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling, which made preschool education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.[40][41]In Mongolia, kindergarten is known as \u0446\u044d\u0446\u044d\u0440\u043b\u044d\u0433 or tsetserleg. As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergartens registered in the country. From those 152 kindergartens, 142 are state-owned. Children begin kindergarten at the age of 2 and finish it by 5. The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called \u044f\u0441\u043b\u044c, which accepts children between 0 and 2 years of age.In Morocco, preschool is known as \u00e9cole maternelle, kuttab, or ar-rawd. State-run, free maternelle schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged 2 to 5 (although in many places, children under 3 may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan Department of Education.In Nepal, kindergartens are run as private institutions, with their lessons conducted in English. The kindergarten education in Nepal is most similar to that of Hong Kong and India. Children start attending kindergarten from the age of 2 until they are at least 5 years old.The kindergartens in Nepal have the following grades:In the Netherlands, the equivalent term to kindergarten was kleuterschool. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term Fr\u00f6belschool was also common, after Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel. However, this term gradually faded in use as the verb Fr\u00f6belen gained a slightly derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged 4\u20136 years), after which children (aged 6\u201312 years) attended primary school (lagere school). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called basisonderwijs (Dutch for primary education). For children under 4, the country offers private, subsidized day care (kinderdagverblijf), which are non-compulsory but nevertheless very popular.In New Zealand, kindergarten can refer to education in the 2 years preceding primary school, from age 3 to 4. Primary Education starts at age 5.The Macedonian equivalent of kindergarten is detska gradinka (\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430), sometimes called zabavishte (\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435) when the children are younger than 4. Detska gradinka is not part of the state's mandatory education because the educational process in the country begins at the age of 5 or 6, i.e. first grade.In Norway, barnehage (children's garden) is the term equivalent to kindergarten, used for children in the ages between 10 months and 6 years. The first barnehager were founded in Norway in the late 19th century. Although they have existed for 120 years, they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, at minimum the manager, should be educated as barnehagel\u00e6rer (kindergarten teacher), previously known as f\u00f8rskolel\u00e6rer (preschool teachers).[42] Children younger than three are often kept separate from the older children, since the youngest are only expected to play, rest and eat. All the children spend time outdoors every day. Many barnehager let the children sleep outdoors too. There is also an institution called barnepark (children's park), which does not need to have certified staff.In Peru, the term nido refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of 6. In 1902 the teacher Elvira Garc\u00eda y Garc\u00eda organized the first kindergarten for children 2 to 8 years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread, through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of Fr\u00f6bel's and Montessori's methods and parental participation.Early childhood education in the Philippines is mandatory, and is classified into:Early childhood education was strengthened through the creation of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980).[43] In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. This is part of the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum. Before K-12, education officially started at the elementary level, and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten was optional.In Poland, Przedszkole (literally Preschool, also commonly known as Zer\u00f3wka or Class 0 [44]) is a preschool educational institution for children aged from 3 to 6, mandatory for children aged 6,[45] and optional for aged 7, whose parents submitted an application for the postponement of primary school.[44]In Romania, gr\u0103dini\u0163\u0103 (literally \"small garden\") is the favored form of education for preschool children usually aged 3\u20136. The children are divided into three age groups: \"little group\" (grupa mic\u0103, age 3\u20134), \"medium group\" (grupa mijlocie, age 4\u20135) and \"big group\" (grupa mare, age 5\u20136). In the last few years private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system. Attending kindergarten is not compulsory.The \"preparatory school year\" (clasa preg\u0103titoare) is for children aged 6\u20137, and since it became compulsory in 2012,[46] it usually takes place inside regular school classrooms and is considered \"year 0\" of elementary education, bridging the gap between kindergarten and years 1\u20134 of elementary school.In the Russian Federation, \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0434 (dyetskiy sad, literal translation of \"children's garden\") is a preschool educational institution for children, usually 3 to 6 years of age.Kindergartens in Singapore provide up to three years of preschool for children ages three to six. The three years are commonly called nursery, kindergarten 1 (K1) and kindergarten 2 (K2), respectively.[47]The People's Action Party, which has governed Singapore since 1957, runs over 370 kindergartens through its charitable arm, the PAP Community Foundation.[47] The kindergartens are run by the private sector, including community foundations, religious bodies, and civic or business groups.Kindergartens (commonly known as creche) in South Africa provide preschool programs for children of all ages up to six. The one to three-year program, known as nursery, kindergarten 1 (K1), and kindergarten 2 (K2), prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.In Spain, kindergarten is called Infantil or Educaci\u00f3n Infantil and covers ages 3 to 6, the three courses being called, respectively, P-3, P-4 and P-5. Though non-mandatory, most children in Spain attend these courses.Before that, children aged 0 to 3 may attend the escuela infantil and take courses P-0, P-1 and P-2. In most parts of Spain escuelas infantiles are specialized schools completely separate from regular schools.Kindergarten in Sudan is divided into private and public kindergarten. Preschool is compulsory in Sudan. Kindergarten age spans from 3\u20136 years. The curriculum covers Arabic, English, religion, mathematics and more.In Sweden, kindergarten activities were established in the 19th century, and have been widely expanded since the 1970s.[48][49] The first Swedish kindergarten teachers were trained by Henriette Schrader-Breymann at the Pestalozzi-Fr\u00f6bel Haus, which she founded in 1882.[48][49]While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in Taiwan, private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. The curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English-speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an English only environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper.[citation needed] Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students' abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English immersion preschools continues to grow.In Uganda, kindergarten is nursery or pre-primary and usually covers ages 3 to 5, the three classes called baby class, middle class and top class, respectively. Pupils graduating from top class then go on to enrol in P1 \u2013 the first year of primary school. Though non-mandatory, most children in Uganda today attend these classes. In most parts of Uganda, nursery schools are specialised schools completely separate from regular primary schools.In 2010, a total of 56% of children aged one to six years old had the opportunity to attend preschool education, the Education and Science Ministry of Ukraine reported in August 2010.[50] Many preschools and kindergartens were closed previously in light of economic and demographic considerations.[51]The term kindergarten is rarely used in the UK to describe modern preschool education or the first years of compulsory primary school education. Preschools are usually known as creche, nursery schools or playgroups, while the first year of schooling is known as Reception in England and Wales and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland (though different terms may be used in the small minority of UK schools which teach primarily through the medium of a language other than English). Nursery forms part of the Foundation Stage of education. In the 1980s, England and Wales officially adopted the Northern Irish system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the local education authority.  In England, schooling is not compulsory until a child's fifth birthday but in practise most children join school in the Reception year the September before their fifth birthday.  In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of 4+1\u20442 and 5+1\u20442 years, depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were 4 by the end of the preceding February).However, the word \"kindergarten\" is used for more specialist organisations such as forest kindergartens and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents. Historically the word was used during the nineteenth century when activists like Adelaide Manning were introducing educators to the work of Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel.[52]In the UK, parents have the option of nursery for their children at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.Some nurseries are attached to state infant or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector. The Scottish government provides funding[53] so that all children from the age of three until they start compulsory school can attend five sessions per week of two and a half hours each, either in state-run or private nurseries. Working parents can also receive from their employers childcare worth \u00a355 per week free of income tax,[54] which is typically enough to pay for one or two days per week.EnglandEvery child in England at the first school term after their third birthday is  entitled to 15 hours per week free childcare funding.[55] Pre-schools in England follow the Early Learning Goals, set by the Early Years Foundation Stage,[56] for education produced by the Department for Education, which carries on into their first year of school at the age of four. This year of school is usually called Reception. The Early Learning Goals cover the main areas of education without being subject driven. These areas include:[57]The three prime areas:The four specific areas:Pupils attend nursery school for four or five terms. It is also common practice for many children to attend nursery much earlier than this. Many nurseries have the facilities to take on babies, using the 'Early Years Foundation Stage' framework as a guide to give each child the best possible start to becoming a competent learner and skilful communicator.[57] Nurseries and playgroups are inspected and regulated by Her Majesty's Inspectors (Office for Standards in Education).The Scottish government defines its requirements for nursery schools in the Early Years Framework[58] and the Curriculum for Excellence.[59] Each school interprets these with more or less independence (depending on their management structure) but must satisfy the Care Inspectorate[60] in order to retain their licence to operate. The curriculum aims to develop:In the United States, kindergarten is usually part of the K\u201312 educational system. In most schools, children begin kindergarten at age five for one year.[61] Forty-three of the fifty states (the exceptions being Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania) require school districts to offer a kindergarten year.[62] Students develop skills such as numeracy, literacy and a greater awareness of the world around them geographically, scientifically, socially and culturally.[63]The following reading list relates specifically to kindergarten in North America, where it is the first year of formal schooling and not part of the preschool system as it is in the rest of the world:",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock (also known as alternative music, alt-rock, or simply alternative) is a category of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. \"Alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late 1970s punk rock.[5]Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegazing. In September 1988, Billboard introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.[6][7]Initially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction, were signed to major labels. But most alternative bands remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.Due to success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes in the early 2000s, an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from post-punk and new wave found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s, establishing the post-punk revival movement.In the past, popular music tastes were dictated by music executives within large entertainment corporations. Record companies signed contracts with those entertainers who were thought to become the most popular, and therefore who could generate the most sales. These bands were able to record their songs in expensive studios, and their works then offered for sale through record store chains that were owned by the entertainment corporations, along with eventually selling the merchandise into big box retailers. Record companies worked with radio and television companies to get the most exposure for their artists. The people making the decisions were business people dealing with music as a product, and those bands who were not making the expected sales figures were then excluded from this system.[8]Before the term alternative rock came into common usage around 1990, the sorts of music to which it refers were known by a variety of terms.[9] In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term Alternative Music to describe the groups he was writing about.[10] In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled \"Rock and Roll Alternative\".[11]  \"College rock\" was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college radio circuit and the tastes of college students.[12] In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged as a result of the punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, NME and Sounds magazines published charts based on small record stores called \"Alternative Charts\". The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term indie was used literally to describe independently distributed records.[13] By 1985, indie had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.[12]The use of the term alternative to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s;[14] at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were new music and post modern, respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to recontextualize sounds of the past.[5][15] A similar term, alternative pop, emerged around 1985.[16]In 1987, Spin magazine categorized college rock band Camper Van Beethoven as \"alternative/indie\", noting that their 1985 song \"Where the Hell Is Bill\" (from Telephone Free Landslide Victory) \"called out the alternative/independent scene and dryly tore it apart.\"[17] David Lowery, then frontman of Camper Van Beethoven, later recalled: \"I remember first seeing that word applied to us... The nearest I could figure is that we seemed like a punk band, but we were playing pop music, so they made up this word alternative for those of us who do that.\"[18] DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American FM radio of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to top 40 radio formats by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, \"Somehow this term 'alternative' got rediscovered and heisted by college radio people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music.\"[19]At first the term referred to intentionally non-mainstream rock acts that were not influenced by \"heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave\" and \"high-energy dance anthems\".[20] Usage of the term would broaden to include new wave, pop, punk rock, post-punk, and occasionally \"college\"/\"indie\" rock, all found on the American \"commercial alternative\" radio stations of the time such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM. Journalist Jim Gerr wrote that Alternative also encompassed variants such as \"rap, trash, metal and industrial\".[21] The bill of the first Lollapalooza, an itinerant festival in North America conceived by Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, reunited \"disparate elements of the alternative rock community\" including Henry Rollins, Butthole Surfers, Ice-T, Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees (as second headliners) and Jane's Addiction (as the headlining act).[21] Covering for MTV the opening date of Lollapalooza in Phoenix in July 1991, Dave Kendall introduced the report saying the festival presented the \"most diverse lineups of alternative rock\".[22] That summer, Farrell had coined the term Alternative Nation.[23]In December 1991, Spin magazine noted: \"this year, for the first time, it became resoundingly clear that what has formerly been considered alternative rock\u2014a college-centered marketing group with fairly lucrative, if limited, potential\u2014has in fact moved into the mainstream.\"[21]In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific.[5] In 1997, Neil Strauss of The New York Times defined alternative rock as \"hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, '70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions.\"[20]Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. Alternative can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is \"fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream\", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote \"the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet.\"[24] However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term \"alternative\" to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach.[25] Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book Alternative Rock cites the formation of the Sex Pistols as well as the release of the albums Horses by Patti Smith and Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock.[26] Until the early 2000s, when indie rock became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms \"indie rock\" and \"alternative rock\" were often used interchangeably;[27] whilst there are aspects which both genres have in common, \"indie rock\" was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American \"alternative rock\".[28]The name \"alternative rock\" essentially serves as an umbrella term for underground music that has emerged in the wake of punk rock since the mid-1980s.[29] Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the commercialism of mainstream culture, although this could be contested ever since some of the major alternative artists have achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onward (especially since the new millennium and beyond). Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth.[30] As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although The New York Times in 1989 asserted that the genre is \"guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback.\"[31] More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism.[30] This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.[32]A precursor to alternative rock existed in the 1960s with the proto-punk scene.[33] The origins of alternative rock can be traced back to The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) by the Velvet Underground,[34] which influenced many alternative rock bands that would come after it.[35] Eccentric and quirky figures of the 1960s, such as Syd Barrett have influence on alternative rock in general.[36]The Dead Kennedys formed the independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 1979, releasing influential underground music such as the 1983 self-titled EP from the Butthole Surfers. By 1984, a majority of groups signed to indie labels mined from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.[37]\"Alternative music is music that hasn't yet achieved a mainstream audience, Alternative isn't new wave any more, it's a disposition of mind. Alternative music is any kind of music that has the potential to reach a wider audience. It also has real strength, real quality, real excitement, and it has to be socially significant, as opposed to Whitney Houston, which is pablum.\"\u2014Mark Josephson, Executive Director of the New Music Seminar speaking in 1988[38]Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.[29] College radio formed an essential part of breaking new alternative music. In the mid-1980s, college station KCPR in San Luis Obispo, California, described in a DJ handbook the tension between popular and \"cutting edge\" songs as played on \"alternative radio\".[39]Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.[40] On September 10, 1988, an Alternative Songs chart was created by Billboard, listing the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations in the US: the first number one was Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Peek-a-Boo\".[41] By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and the Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.[42]In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US.[43] Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.[44]Early American alternative bands such as the Dream Syndicate, the Bongos, 10,000 Maniacs, R.E.M., the Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; their debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers.[45] One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as the Velvet Underground.[29]American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.[46] Minneapolis bands H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.[29] Michael Azerrad asserted that H\u00fcsker D\u00fc was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, \"H\u00fcsker D\u00fc played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical.\"[47] The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as \"a viable commercial enterprise\".[48] By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, the Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that \"along with R.E.M., they were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked.\"[49]By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard[50]) and industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston's Pixies and Los Angeles' Jane's Addiction.[29] Around the same time, the grunge subgenre emerged in Seattle, Washington, initially referred to as \"The Seattle Sound\" until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s.[51] Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that syncretized heavy metal and punk rock.[52] Promoted largely by Seattle indie label Sub Pop, grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather.[53] Early grunge bands Soundgarden and Mudhoney found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively.[29]By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough.[54][55] Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.[29]In the middle of the decade, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's album Zen Arcade influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.'s hardcore scene what was called \"emocore\" or, later, \"emo\" emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional, very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. Rites of Spring has been described as the first \"emo\" band. Former Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye founded Dischord Records which became the center for the city's emo scene.[56]Gothic rock developed out of late-1970s British post-punk. With a reputation as the \"darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock\", gothic rock utilizes a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct \"foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes\", and the subgenre's lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism.[57] Bands of this subgenre took inspiration from two British post-punk groups, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees.[58] Bauhaus' debut single \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock subgenre.[59] The Cure's \"oppressively dispirited\" albums including Pornography (1982) cemented that group's stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.[60]The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was Manchester's the Smiths. Music journalist Simon Reynolds singled out the Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as \"the two most important alt-rock bands of the day\", commenting that they \"were eighties bands only in the sense of being against the eighties\".[61] The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer Morrissey's English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist Johnny Marr's jangly guitar-playing style.[43] The C86 cassette, a 1986 NME premium featuring Primal Scream, the Wedding Present and others, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole.[62][63]Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. the Jesus and Mary Chain's sound combined the Velvet Underground's \"melancholy noise\" with Beach Boys pop melodies and Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" production,[64][65] while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with disco and dance music.[43] The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., C86 and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the formative influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar effects pedals[66] onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive created an overwhelmingly loud \"wash of sound\" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback.[67] Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the Madchester scene. Performing for the most part in the Ha\u00e7ienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.[68]By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels had already signed Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dinosaur Jr.[54] In early 1991, R.E.M. went mainstream worldwide with Out of Time while becoming a blueprint for many alternative bands.[29]The first edition of the Lollapalooza festival became the most successful tour in North America in July and August 1991. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who caught it near Los Angeles in an open-air amphitheater, \"it felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all\". The tour helped change the mentalities in the music industry: \"by that fall, radio and MTV and music had changed. I really think that if it weren\u2019t for Perry [Farrell], if it weren\u2019t for Lollapalooza, you and I wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation right now\".[69]The release of the Nirvana's single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in September 1991 \"marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon\". Helped by constant airplay of the song's music video on MTV, their album Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991.[70] Its success surprised the music industry. Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established \"the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.\"[71] Michael Azerrad asserted that Nevermind symbolized \"a sea-change in rock music\" in which the hair metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant.[72] The breakthrough success of Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s. It heralded a \"new openness to alternative rock\" among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular.[73] In the wake of Nevermind, alternative rock \"found itself dragged-kicking and screaming\u00a0... into the mainstream\" and record companies, confused by the genre's success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands.[74] The New York Times declared in 1993, \"Alternative rock doesn't seem so alternative anymore. Every major label has a handful of guitar-driven bands in shapeless shirts and threadbare jeans, bands with bad posture and good riffs who cultivate the oblique and the evasive, who conceal catchy tunes with noise and hide craftsmanship behind nonchalance.\"[75] However, many alternative rock artists rejected success, for it conflicted with the rebellious, DIY ethic the genre had espoused before mainstream exposure and their ideas of artistic authenticity.[76]Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. Pearl Jam had released its debut album Ten a month before Nevermind in 1991, but album sales only picked up a year later.[77] By the second half of 1992 Ten became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard 200 album chart.[78] Soundgarden's album Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core along with the Temple of the Dog album collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992.[79] The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle \"the new Liverpool\".[53] Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success.[80]At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. Entertainment Weekly commented in a 1993 article, \"There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s.\"[81] The New York Times compared the \"grunging of America\" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years. As a result of the genre's popularity, a backlash against grunge developed in Seattle.[53] Nirvana's follow-up album In Utero (1993) was an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a \"wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record.\"[82] Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993 In Utero topped the Billboard charts.[83] Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, Vs. (1993), which topped the Billboard charts by selling a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release.[84]With the decline of the Madchester scene and the unglamorousness of shoegazing, the tide of grunge from America dominated the British alternative scene and music press in the early 1990s.[43] As a reaction, a flurry of British bands emerged that wished to \"get rid of grunge\" and \"declare war on America\", taking the public and native music press by storm.[85] Dubbed \"Britpop\" by the media, this movement represented by Pulp, Blur, Suede, and Oasis was the British equivalent of the grunge explosion, in that the artists propelled alternative rock to the top of the charts in their home country.[43] Britpop bands were influenced by and displayed reverence for British guitar music of the past, particularly movements and genres such as the British Invasion, glam rock, and punk rock.[86] In 1995 the Britpop phenomenon culminated in a rivalry between its two chief groups, Oasis and Blur, symbolized by their release of competing singles on the same day. Blur won \"The Battle of Britpop\", but Oasis soon eclipsed the other band in popularity with their second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995),[87] which went on to become the third best-selling album in the UK's history.[88]Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the US, indie rock became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana.[89] Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of alternative rock's absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its \"macho\" aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as \"the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place\".[89]Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like Pavement, Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney dominated the American indie scene for most of the 1990s.[90] One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was lo-fi. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality cassette tapes, initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences.[91] The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, PJ Harvey fit into this sub group.[92]During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely \"a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock.\"; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, \"but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists.\"[93] Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.[93] Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an \"authentic\" rock movement.[94] Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of About.com, is \"suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music.\"[94] Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters, Creed and Nickelback emerged.[94]Post-rock was established by Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland albums, both released in 1991.[95] Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including Krautrock, progressive rock, and jazz. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music.[95] While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994 referring to Hex by the London group Bark Psychosis,[96] the style of the genre was solidified by the release of Millions Now Living Will Never Die (1996) by the Chicago group Tortoise.[95] Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure.[95] A related genre, math rock, peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock relies on more complex time signatures and intertwining phrases.[97] By the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its \"dispassionate intellectuality\" and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R\u00f3s emerged who further expanded the genre.[95]In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream was a major commercial success. The strong influence of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio.[98]\nIn 1995, Smashing Pumpkins also released their double album Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness which went on to sell 10\u00a0million copies in the US alone, certifying it as a Diamond record.After almost a decade in the underground, ska punk, a mixture of earlier British ska and punk acts, became popular in the United States. Rancid was the first of the \"Third Wave Ska Revival\" acts to break. In 1996, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt, Sublime, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and Save Ferris charted or received radio exposure.[99][100]The Amerindie of the early '80s became known as alternative or alt-rock, ascendant from Nirvana until 1996 or so but currently very unfashionable, never mind that the music is still there.\u2014 Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s (2000)[101]By the end of the decade, alternative rock's style changed due to a number of events, notably the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter Ticketmaster, which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States.[76] In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, Be Here Now (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock.[102] A signifier of alternative rock's changes was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, \"Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now\".[103]Despite a change in style, alternative rock still managed to be mainstream. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States.[93] At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.[104]In the mid-1990s, Sunny Day Real Estate defined the emo genre. Weezer's album Pinkerton (1996) was also influential. By 2000 and on into the new decade, emo was one of the most popular rock music genres.[56] Popular acts included the sales success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most (2003).[105] The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations.[105] At the same time, use of the term \"emo\" expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion.[106] Emo's mainstream success continued with bands emerging in the 2000s, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy[107] and My Chemical Romance[108] and mainstream groups such as Paramore[107] and Panic! at the Disco.[109]During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol and the Rapture that drew primary inspiration from post-punk and new wave, establishing the post-punk revival movement.[110] Preceded by the success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes earlier in the decade, an influx of new alternative rock bands, including several post-punk revival artists and others such as the Killers, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s. Owing to the success of these bands, Entertainment Weekly declared in 2004, \"After almost a decade of domination by rap-rock and nu-metal bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again.\"[111] Thirty Seconds to Mars experienced a notable rise in popularity during the latter half of the 2000s.[112] American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album Californication (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s. Arctic Monkeys were a prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking,[113] with two UK No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.[114]Most references to alternative rock music in the United States past 2010 are to the indie rock genre, a term that previously had limited usage on alternative rock channels and media.[27] Radio stations in the 2010s have been changing formats away from alternative rock, but this is mostly motivated by conglomeration efforts coupled with advertisers seeking more Top 40/Top 100 stations for sales.[115]  While there have been conflicting opinions on the relevance of alternative rock to mainstream audiences beyond 2010,[116][117] Dave Grohl commented on an article from the December 29, 2013 issue of the New York Daily News stating that rock is dead:[118] \"speak for yourself... rock seems pretty alive to me.\"[119]Contemporary mainstream alternative rock bands tend to fuse musical elements of hard rock, electronica, hip-hop, indie and punk while placing emphasis on keyboards and guitar. In 2010s, British rock band Muse gained a worldwide recognition with their album The Resistance and Drones which won Grammy Awards.[120][121] American alternative duo Twenty One Pilots blurs the lines between genres including hip hop, emo, rock, indie pop and reggae and has managed to break numerous records.[122] They became the first alternative act to have two concurrent top five singles in the United States while their fourth studio album Blurryface (2015) was the first album in history to have every song receive at least a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[123][124][125] Twenty One Pilots also became the first rock act to have a song reach a billion streams on Spotify.[126] Their breakout hit single \"Stressed Out\" was the twenty-fifth song to achieve the rare feat of at least one billion plays on the streaming platform. The milestone comes at a time when music genres represented on streaming platforms like Spotify are fairly homogeneous, being dominated by genres such as hip hop, EDM, and adult contemporary-styled pop.[126]Alternative pop is a term that originated in the mid-1980s to describe underground pop music that experimented with an eclectic range of influences and musically challenging arrangements.[127] According to AllMusic's entry for \"alternative pop/rock\", the \u201cleft-of-center pop\u201d of the genre failed to experience mainstream success during the 1980s.[128]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/No_Doubt": "No Doubt was an American rock band from Anaheim, California, formed in 1986. For most of their career, the band consisted of vocalist Gwen Stefani, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist Tony Kanal, and drummer Adrian Young. Since the mid-1990s, they were supported by trombonist and keyboardist Gabrial McNair and trumpeter and keyboardist Stephen Bradley in live performances.Though their 1992 eponymous debut album failed to make an impact, its ska punk\u2013inspired follow-up The Beacon Street Collection sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over triple that of its predecessor. The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom (1995) benefited from the resurgence of third-wave ska in the 1990s, and \"Don't Speak\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. \"Just a Girl\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".[2]The group's next album, Return of Saturn (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single \"Simple Kind of Life\", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album Rock Steady (2001), which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, \"Hey Baby\" and \"Underneath It All\". \"Hella Good\" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in Disneyland during the band's appearance on (KROQ-FM) where they performed five songs.[3] After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004) and The Sweet Escape (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled Push and Shove (2012), and released their single \"Settle Down\". They have sold over 33 million records worldwide.Eric Stefani and John Spence met at a Dairy Queen, and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister Gwen Stefani (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez (trumpet), Alan Meade (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.[2]Tony Kanal went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her.[4] Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.[5] The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987 with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt's set included \"Total Hate\", \"Too Much Pressure\", \"Danger\", \"Paulina\", \"Gangsters\", and the song \"No Doubt\". Video clips from the party have appeared on VH1's Behind the Music.In December 1987, Spence died by suicide, several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees.[4] No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks[4] with Alan Meade taking over vocals.[6] When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer,[6] and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California.[4] In early 1988, Tom Dumont left Rising, a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister,[7] stating that local metal bands \"were into drinking, wearing Spandex\" but that he wanted to focus on music.[8] He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band's guitarist. Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as their drummer the following year.[4] During this time period, No Doubt played gigs at local colleges, Fender's Grand Ballroom, The Whisky, The Roxy, many shows with The Untouchables, Fishbone, and a show with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Cal State Long Beach. Caseley left No Doubt in July 1989 for the US Navy Band.[citation needed]Impressed by the presence of stage diving fans at No Doubt's concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1990.[4] No Doubt's self-titled debut album was finally released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for \"Trapped in a Box\". The album's distinctly upbeat pop/cartoon sound sharply contrasted with the then-dominant grunge movement. Owing to the music world's direct focus on grunge, No Doubt's album was not supported by the record label, and was considered a commercial failure for selling only 30,000 copies.[6] The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album, though Interscope refused to support the tour.[9] The band failed to bring the audiences that it had attracted in southern California, and often found that No Doubt was not even available in the cities where it was playing.[4] Eric Stefani began to withdraw from the group, vacillating between being in and out of the band.[10]The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the cartoon TV series The Simpsons.[4] Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed \"space\".[11] Unsure of what to do with the band, Interscope sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1993.[12] No Doubt released The Beacon Street Collection, consisting of outtakes from its previous recording sessions, in 1995 on its own label, Beacon Street Records. Mixing 1980s punk rock and some grunge influences into the band's sound, the album contains a rawer sound than No Doubt,[13] and it sold more than three times as many copies as its predecessor.[7] Later that year, Trauma Records released Tragic Kingdom, much of which dealt with the relationship between Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani.[14]The release of 1995's Tragic Kingdom and the single \"Just a Girl\" allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success. No Doubt began touring in support of the album late that year, and it grew into a 27-month international tour.[15] In 1996, the second single, \"Spiderwebs\", was successful, and \"Don't Speak\", a ballad written by Gwen and Eric Stefani about Gwen and Kanal's break-up,[16] was released as the third single and broke the previous record when it topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay for sixteen non-consecutive weeks. No Doubt was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards. By the end of the year, half of the songs on Tragic Kingdom had been released as singles, and the album was certified eight times platinum. Later, they were nominated for two more Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, both for \"Don't Speak\".[13] The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album diamond in February 1999,[17] and with worldwide sales of sixteen million.[18] Through the success of Tragic Kingdom, the band's self-titled debut album began again to sell copies, and reached total sales of over a quarter of a million copies.[7]The album's release fueled a dispute between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt's recording contract. Trauma sued for US$100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion and sought to have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected.[12] No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was \"really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label.\"[19] The case was settled out of court with a $3 million payment.[20]The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom.[4] Live in the Tragic Kingdom, a live long-form video of the band's performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, was released and The Beacon Street Collection was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded \"I Throw My Toys Around\" with Elvis Costello for The Rugrats Movie, and it contributed to The Clash's tribute album Burning London: The Clash Tribute. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Prince, Fishbone, and Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale's band Bush. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song \"New\" on the soundtrack to the movie Go in 1999. \"New\", inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of Tragic Kingdom.\nIn 2000, the band released Return of Saturn, its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt's previous work.[21] The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani's relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale.[15] Return of Saturn was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, \"Ex-Girlfriend\", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Also released as singles from the album were the tracks \"Simple Kind of Life\" and \"Bathwater\". Lukewarm sales drastically shortened the tour that followed, appearing only in festival settings in L.A., Cincinnati, Nashville, Jacksonville and Miami. On August 10, No Doubt went on VH1 Storytellers and performed a few of their songs, and were joined by friend Alain Johannes (of Eleven) and former member Eric Stefani.[7]After Return of Saturn, the band returned to recording in January 2001. During this time, it contributed a cover version of Donna Summer's \"Love to Love You Baby\" for the Zoolander soundtrack and recorded a song with Kelis for her album Wanderland. Stefani made high-profile appearances on Moby's \"South Side\" and Eve's \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\". These appearances lent No Doubt credibility and an opportunity to explore new genres.[22] Highly influenced by Jamaican dancehall music and recorded primarily in Jamaica, the band's 2001 studio album, Rock Steady, produced two hit Grammy-winning singles, \"Hey Baby\", which featured Bounty Killer, and \"Underneath It All\", which featured \"the first lady of dancehall\", Lady Saw. Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released \"Hella Good\" and \"Running\" as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on \"Waiting Room\" from Rock Steady. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince's Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic album, \"So Far, So Pleased\". In November 2002, No Doubt made an appearance in the Dawson's Creek episode \"Spiderwebs\".[23]In January 2003, No Doubt performed in the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show.2003 was a big year of releases for No Doubt. The album The Singles 1992\u20132003, a compilation of the band's commercially released singles, was released on November 25, 2003. It included a cover of the song \"It's My Life\", which had originally been a hit for synthpop group Talk Talk in 1984, and earned No Doubt a Grammy nomination for Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal.[24] Additionally, a special 2-CD 2-DVD box set titled Boom Box was made available, which included the CDs The Singles 1992\u20132003 and Everything in Time and the DVDs The Videos 1992\u20132003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. Separately, Rock Steady Live, a DVD of the band performing in Long Beach from their Rock Steady tour was released in 2003 as well. The next year, the band was featured in a re-recording of the Toots and the Maytals classic song \"Monkey Man\". The band also toured with Blink-182 in mid-2004, before embarking on a hiatus.Lead singer Gwen Stefani began work on her 1980s-inspired new wave and dance-pop side project in 2003, which eventually evolved into the full-fledged solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby., released on November 23, 2004. The album reached multi-platinum status in several countries, including a quintuple platinum certification in Canada[25] and triple platinum in the US.[26]No Doubt was featured on the album True Love by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.[27]Stefani launched her first solo arena tour in October 2005, which coincided with the news of her pregnancy (her son, Kingston James McGregor Rossdale, was born on May 26, 2006). She released her second solo dance-pop album, The Sweet Escape in December 2006. Tony Kanal helped with the production of the album as well.In early 2005, Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord, with friend and collaborator Ted Matson, and backed up Matt Costa on his 2005 tour.[28] Adrian Young, the band's drummer, did the drums for Bow Wow Wow's 2004 tour and many of the tracks on Unwritten Law's 2005 release Here's to the Mourning,[29] as well as featuring on several shows in 2006 for TheStart.[30] Young also played on Rock Star: Supernova runner-up Dilana's Inside Out album.[31][32]In 2008, Tony Kanal collaborated with pop rock artist Pink on the album Funhouse. Kanal co-produced \"Sober\", co-wrote \"Funhouse\" and also sang back-up vocals on \"Crystal Ball\".[33]With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began initial work on a new album without her[34] and planned to complete it after Stefani's tour was finished.[35] However, songwriting was slow as Gwen Stefani was, at the time, pregnant with her second child.[36][37] The album was produced by Mark \"Spike\" Stent, who helped produce and mix Rock Steady.No Doubt announced on their official website that they would tour in the summer of 2009 with Paramore, The Sounds, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry, Panic! at the Disco, and Matt Costa, all while finishing their upcoming album, which was set for release in 2010.[38] As a special promotion for the tour, the band was giving away their entire music catalog free as a digital download with purchase of top-tier seating.[39]The band released another compilation album on November 2 called Icon, in preparation for their upcoming comeback album. Icon featured the same track listing as their previous compilation album The Singles 1992\u20132003 albeit with new artwork and a low price point.[40]On June 11, 2012, the band announced on their official website that the new album would be out on September 25, preceded by the first single on July 16. The album was titled Push and Shove and the first single was a song called \"Settle Down\". The music video for \"Settle Down\" was directed by Sophie Muller (who has previously directed numerous music videos for No Doubt).[41][42] \"Settle Down\" peaked at #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the album peaking at #3. On November 3, 2012, the band pulled its music video \"Looking Hot\" from the Internet after receiving complaints that it was insensitive towards Native Americans.[43]As of February 1, 2013, the band stated via Twitter that they had \"Finished a week of songwriting\", implying that they have more new tracks written.[44] As of February 26, 2013, the band officially confirmed through their website that they had indeed begun working on new music as well as plans for an upcoming tour.[45][46]In October 2013 Tom revealed on social networking site Twitter that the band was once again on hiatus, also hinting that the band will regroup in 2014.[47][48] No Doubt performed at the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park on September 27, 2014. They also announced via Twitter that they would perform at Rock in Rio USA in May 2015. With the release of Gwen Stefani's solo single \"Baby Don't Lie\", she announced that No Doubt were working on a new album.[49] However, during an interview with the Orange County Register in April 2015, Tony Kanal stated that the band was not working on any new material.[50]No Doubt performed at several events during 2015, including Global Citizen Earth Day Concert,[51] Rock In Rio USA,[52] and was expected to perform at Jazz Aspen Snowmass, in Colorado,[53] Riot Fest and Carnival[54] in Chicago, and Kaaboo in Del Mar, California.[55]In a June 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty over the future of No Doubt. \"I don't know what's going to happen with No Doubt. When Tony [Kanal] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [2012's Push and Shove]. And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard.\"[56]No Doubt's musical style has been characterized as ska punk, reggae fusion,[1] punk rock, pop punk, new wave, alternative rock and pop rock.The band's debut album blended the ska punk, alternative rock and new wave genres. However, the band utilized a punk rock sound in their second album The Beacon Street Collection[57] and their third album Tragic Kingdom, although the latter incorporated pop punk and alternative rock influences. They later shed their punk rock roots for the following album Return of Saturn, utilizing influences from new wave music and pop rock.[58]The band completely altered their sound in their next album Rock Steady, incorporating Jamaican music influences from reggae fusion, rocksteady and dance-rock.[59] However the band's comeback album Push and Shove blended pop rock, new wave music and dancehall;[60] the English electronic bands New Order and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) were cited as key influences on the album.[61]In 2009, No Doubt made an appearance on the television series Gossip Girl, playing a fictional band called \"Snowed Out\" in the episode \"Valley Girls\".[62] They performed a cover version of the Adam and the Ants song \"Stand and Deliver\".[63]No Doubt played at the Bridge School Benefit organized by Neil Young on October 24 and 25, 2009, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.[64]On December 5, 2010, No Doubt performed a tribute to Paul McCartney at The Kennedy Center Honors, playing a medley of Beatles hits including \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"All My Loving\", and \"Penny Lane\". The band performed for President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey.[65]The band also appeared as guests in the animated show King of the Hill[66] and the sketch comedy program Portlandia.[67] They can also be seen in a scene of the Simpsons episode \"Homerpalooza\". At the time Eric Stefani was one of the show's animators, and inserted his sister and her bandmates behind Homer in the scene where the crowd riots against him.[68]On November 4, 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that No Doubt had filed a lawsuit over its portrayal in the music video game Band Hero. The lawsuit alleged that the game had \"transformed No Doubt band members into a virtual karaoke circus act\", singing dozens of songs the group neither wrote, popularized, nor approved for use in the game. The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited Activision, the game's distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of No Doubt.[69]On February 15, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District affirmed the trial court's denial of Activision's special motion to strike No Doubt's lawsuit as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, after an interlocutory appeal by Activision.[70] The appellate court explained that the dispute arose from No Doubt's discovery, two weeks before Band Hero went on sale, that its band members could be manipulated in the game to perform songs they would never perform in real life. The court then explained: \"The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani's avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members' avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups.\" The court then ruled that Activision's First Amendment defense was meritless, No Doubt had a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits, and that No Doubt was entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred in opposing Activision's appeal.[citation needed]In 2012, the issue was settled out of court, two weeks before scheduled trial date.[71]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pearl_Jam": "Pearl Jam is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. The band's lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), and Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), as well as Matt Cameron (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade,[1] being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\".[2]Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13\u00d7 platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"[3]Pearl Jam had sold more than 85\u00a0million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32\u00a0million albums in the United States by 2012,[4] making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility.[5] They were ranked at No. 8 in a reader poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue.[6] Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues.Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner.[7] In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.[8]Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.[9] After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.[3] After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.[9]Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball friend, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder.[10] Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.[9] He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs (\"Alive\", \"Once\", and \"Footsteps\") in what he later described as a \"mini-opera\" entitled Momma-Son.[11] Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.[9]With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active basketball player.[12] The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Caf\u00e9 in Seattle on October 22, 1990.[13] They opened for Alice in Chains at the Moore Theatre in Seattle on December 22, 1990,[14] and served as the opening act for the band's  Facelift tour in 1991.[15][16]  Mookie Blaylock soon signed to Epic Records and renamed themselves Pearl Jam.[2] In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name \"Pearl Jam\" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.[17] In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was \"total bullshit\", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with \"pearl\", and that the band later settled on \"Pearl Jam\" after attending a Neil Young concert, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15\u201320 minutes in length.[3]Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten.[18] McCready said that \"Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time.\"[19] Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation for alcoholism;[20] he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the \"Alive\" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band.[12] Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten.[12]Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)[17] contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an \"expansive harmonic vocabulary\" with an anthemic sound.[21] The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts.[18] Ten produced the hit singles \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,[9] Vedder later revealed that \"Alive\" tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. In this lyric, even though Vedder originally looked at \"being alive as a curse,\" as the sadness the speaker in the song suggests, \"...But as fans quickly turned the title phrase into a self-empowering anthem,\" particularly at Pearl Jam concerts, Vedder said, \"they lifted the curse. The audience changed the meaning for me,\" he told VH1 Storytellers in 2006.[22]The song \"Jeremy\" and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.[23] Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13\u00d7 platinum.[24]With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was \"trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets.\"[25] Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts,[26] and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads.[18] Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.[3]Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that \"essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour,\" adding, \"We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'\"[27] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, \"Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it.\"[19] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that \"playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"[28]In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's Lollapalooza tour with Ministry, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden, among others.[29][30][31] The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: \"State of Love and Trust\" and \"Breath\". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name \"Citizen Dick\"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.[32]The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.[9] While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \"Jeremy\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \"Black\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\"[33]\n\"Ten years from now,\" Ament said, \"I don't want people to remember our songs as videos.\"[9]Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, \"The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.\"[34] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined.[35] The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live.[36] Vs. included the singles \"Go\", \"Daughter\", \"Animal\", and \"Dissident\". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, \"Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut.\" He added, \"Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife.\"[37] The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts.[38] The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of \"Jeremy\" and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band \"ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans.\"[39] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.[40]By 1994, Pearl Jam was \"fighting on all fronts\", as its manager described the band at the time.[41] Reporter Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers.[42] Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jam's efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed, which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips' investigative series[43][44][45][46][47][48] in a well known legal monograph[49] concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts with venues and contracts to cover such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, \"The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994, in Washington, D.C.[50] Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam's manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.[51]\nThe band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest.[52] After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company.[53] The band tried to work around Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts by hosting charities and benefits at major venues, because the exclusive contracts often contained a clause allowing charity event promoters to sell their own tickets.[54] Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, \"the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year.\" He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster was to blame for the delay.[41]Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for Vitalogy were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O'Brien said, \"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\"[19][55] After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.[19][55] He was replaced by Jack Irons, who had connected Vedder to the rest of the band some four years prior. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.[56]Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994, on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994, on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.[13] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\"[57] Many of the songs on the album appear to be inspired by the pressures of fame.[58] The song \"Spin the Black Circle\", an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs \"Not for You\", \"Corduroy\", \"Better Man\", and \"Immortality\". \"Better Man\" (\u00a0sample), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.[19][55]The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.[59] Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.[60] Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.\"[19][55] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.[2] Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: \"I Got Id\" and \"Long Road\". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\"[61] Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten,[62] favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"[63] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination,[64] with Ament stating, \"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\"[64] Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \"Who You Are\" (\u00a0sample\u00a0(help\u00b7info)), \"Hail, Hail\", and \"Off He Goes\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\" and that \"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\"[19][55]Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort among all members of the group, with Ament stating that \"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\"[65] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.[66] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has \"turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten.\"[67] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code,[68] with Vedder saying, \"What was rage in the past has become reflection.\"[69] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts.[70] It included the singles \"Given to Fly\" and \"Wishlist\". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song \"Do the Evolution\" from the album, its first music video since 1992.[71] A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis,[72] but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the band's return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to \"better accommodate concertgoers.\"[73] The 1998 summer tour was a big success,[74] and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour.In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded \"Last Kiss\", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War.[13] The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. \"Last Kiss\" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single.Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique.[75] Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members \"were ready for a change.\"[34] Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, \"Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere.\" He added, \"The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd.\"[76] The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as \"pretty sombre.\"[68] Binaural included the singles \"Nothing as It Seems\", one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and \"Light Years\". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.[77]Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings,[78] and these \"official bootlegs\" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans.[79] Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and twice set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.[80][81]Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.[82]A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that \"playing, facing crowds, being together\u2014it enabled us to start processing it.\"[19][55] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that \"I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something.\"[83] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song \"Long Road\" from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families.Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \"a pretty positive one\" and \"very intense and spiritual.\"[84] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\"[85] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \"I Am Mine\" and \"Save You\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \"Love Boat Captain\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy\u2014a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\"[86] The track entitled \"Arc\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.[87]In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \"Bu$hleaguer\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \"impaled\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.[88]In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had \"no interest\" in signing with another label.[89] The band's first release without a label was the single for \"Man of the Hour\", in partnership with Amazon.com.[90] Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. \"Man of the Hour\", which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish.The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG.[91] 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song \"Yellow Ledbetter\" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends.[92] Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records.[93]Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.[94]The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG), though J has since folded into RCA Records.[95] The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band's early sound,[96][97] and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview.[98] Ament said, \"The band playing in a room\u2014that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for.\"[99] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that \"in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas.\"[100] Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. \"World Wide Suicide\", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since \"Who You Are\" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when \"Given to Fly\" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles \"Life Wasted\" and \"Gone\".To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.[101] The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with \"guts\" but with trust in the audience.[102]In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's \"Love, Reign o'er Me\" for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store.[103] The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007.[104] The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre,[105] and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released.[106]In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.[107] The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in the Eastern United States.[108] In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips.[109] In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.[110]In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its concert of September 20, 1992 at Magnuson Park in Seattle.[111] It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog that led up to the band's 20th anniversary in 2011.[111] A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty[112] was also planned to coincide with the anniversary.[113] In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form.[112]Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008.[114] In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008.[115] The band's ninth studio album, Backspacer, was its first to be produced by Brendan O'Brien since Yield.[114] Backspacer debuted at No.\u00a01 on the Billboard music charts, the band's first album to do so since No Code in 1996,[116] and has sold 635,000 copies as of July 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[117] The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and new wave.[118] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \"prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun.\"[119] Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, \"I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now.\"[120] \"The Fixer\" was chosen as the album's first single.[121] Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band's official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes.[122][123] In an interview in September 2009 McCready revealed that Pearl Jam was scheduled to finish the Backspacer outtakes within six months,[124] and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band's next studio album.[125]In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival,[126] the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival,[127] and played five shows in Europe and three in North America.[128][129][130] In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival.[131] Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards.[123] In May 2010, the band embarked on a month-long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York.[132] A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland for the first time at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast.[133] In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.[134] A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011.[135] It is a compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live on Two Legs, which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour.[136]In March 2011, bassist Jeff Ament told Billboard that the band had 25 songs and they'd be heading into the studio in April to begin recording the follow-up to Backspacer.[137] On May 16, 2011, the band confirmed that they would play the Labor Day weekend at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, East Troy, Wisconsin, followed by ten shows in Canada.[138]On September 8, 2011, the band released a new song titled \"Ol\u00e9\".[139] On November 18, the band released Toronto 9.11.11\u2014a free live album available through the launch of Google Music.On November 21, 2011, as part of their PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica for the first time to a 30,000 crowd of fans at the National Stadium.[140] The following month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012.[141]On July 11, 2013, the band announced that their tenth studio album Lightning Bolt would be released internationally on October 14, 2013, and on the next day in the United States, along with releasing the first single \"Mind Your Manners\".[142] The band played a two-leg tour in North America during October and November,[143] followed by headlining the final Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand in 2014.[144][145] The second single, \"Sirens\", was released on September 18, 2013.[146] After selling 166,000 copies in its first week, Lightning Bolt became Pearl Jam's fifth album to reach number one on the Billboard 200.[147] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, the album won the award for Best Recording Package.[148] In November 2015 the band played a nine-date tour of Latin America.[149]In January 2016, the band announced a tour of the United States and Canada, including appearances at the New Orleans Jazz Festival and Bonnaroo.[150] In April 2017, Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the ceremony they were inducted by comedian David Letterman.[151] In August 2017, the band announced the release of the live album and concert film Let's Play Two, from the band's shows at Wrigley Field the previous year.[152]The band launched a 2018 tour with shows in South America in March 2018, including shows at the Lollapalooza festival events in Brazil, Chile and Argentina, with the latter being cancelled due to heavy rain the night before.[153] followed by performances in Europe and North America.[154] The tour included two shows for homelessness-related charities in the band's hometown of Seattle.[155]Prior to the first shows of the tour, Pearl Jam released a new song, \"Can't Deny Me\".[156][157] In December 2019, Pearl Jam confirmed that they would be touring Europe in the summer of 2020.[158][159] On January 13, 2020, the band announced that their eleventh studio album, Gigaton, would be released on March 27, 2020.[160] In conjunction with the release of their eleventh studio album, the band also announced tour dates in North America during March and April 2020.[161] However, the North American leg was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim to reschedule them for a later date.[162][163] In September 2020, the band confirmed that their MTV Unplugged live set would be released on vinyl and CD for the first time the following month.[164]In May 2021, Pearl Jam announced the release of a digital collection of nearly 200 concerts dating from 2000 to 2013.[165] The collection of 5,404 individual songs, entitled Deep, is accessible by members of the Pearl Jam Ten Club.[166] On September 18, 2021, the band played their first show since 2018 at the Sea.Hear.Now Festival in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer made his debut as a touring musician with the band.[167]Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s.[168] Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Kiss and the Ramones.[169][170] Pearl Jam's success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses \"the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.\"[2] Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove,[171] while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix,[172] has been described as \"feel-oriented\" and \"rootsy.\"[173]Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, \"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\"[3] By 1994's Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.[174] The band's 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism.[2] After Yield in 1998, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,[66] they dabbled with experimental art rock on the Binaural album of 2000, and with folk rock elements on the 2002 Riot Act album. The band's 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to their early sound.[96][97] Their 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and new wave.[118]Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a \"Jim Morrison-like vocal growl.\"[175] Greg Prato of AllMusic said, \"With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock.\"[176] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal (\"Alive\", \"Better Man\") to social and political concerns (\"Even Flow\", \"World Wide Suicide\"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.[177] When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, \"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.\"[178]While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s with Nevermind, Pearl Jam's debut Ten outsold it in the United States,[179] and the band became \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\" according to AllMusic.[2] Pearl Jam has been described as \"modern rock radio's most influential stylists\u00a0\u2013 the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like \"Alive\" and \"Even Flow\" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along.\"[180] The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, including Silverchair, Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes.[181][182] The band has also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.[183]Pearl Jam were ranked at number 8 by Rolling Stone magazine in its Top Ten Live Acts of all Time issue.[6] Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it \"proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\"[184] Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, \"The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists.\"[19][55] In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.[185] In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for \"Best Live Act\" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam \"the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last.\"[186] Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam \"toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon,  true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2.\"[3]When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, \"I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren't always easy, but I think we found a way.\"[187] Their 1992 MTV Unplugged performance was ranked second in Rolling Stone's list of its 15 Best Episodes.[188]Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.[189][190] Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.[191] Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song \"Army Reserve\" (from Pearl Jam).[192]The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled \"Reclamation\", which detailed his views on abortion.[193] In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote \"PRO-CHOICE!\" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song \"Porch\".[19][55] The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.[190]As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000,[194] and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. president. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, \"I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in.\"[195]In 2006, the members of Pearl Jam founded the non-profit organization Vitalogy Foundation. Named after their third studio album, the foundation supports non-profit organizations working in the fields of community health, the environment, arts, education and social change.[196]Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including \"Bu$hleaguer\" and \"World Wide Suicide\", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan,[197] and at the end of \"Daughter\", he sang the lyrics \"George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home\". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to \"No More\" and \"Rockin' in the Free World\".[198] The band later discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of the event, and questioned whether that constitutes censorship.[199] AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment.[200]Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.[201] The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America.[202]In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions.[203]Current membersTouring/session membersFormer members",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/The_White_Stripes": "The White Stripes were an American rock duo from Detroit, Michigan formed in 1997. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single \"Seven Nation Army\", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the opening riff,[1] became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, Get Behind Me Satan in 2005 and Icky Thump in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.[2]The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black\u2014which was used on every album and single cover the band released\u2014as well as the band's fascination with the number three.[3] The band's discography consists of six studio albums, two live albums, one extended play (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.[4] In 2015, Rolling Stone named them the sixth greatest duo of all time.[5]In high school, Jack Gillis (as he was then known)[6] met Meg White at the Memphis Smoke\u2014the restaurant where she worked and where he would read his poetry at open mic nights.[7] The two became friends, and began to frequent the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area.[8]  By this time, Gillis was already playing drums with musician friends, including his upholstery apprenticeship mentor, Brian Muldoon.[9][10] In 1994, he got his first professional job as the drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas.[11][12][13]After dating for several years, Gillis and White married on September 21, 1996.[14][15] Contrary to convention, he took his wife's surname.[9][16] Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band the Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), the Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle. On Bastille Day 1997,[17] Meg started learning to play the drums. In Jack's words, \"When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was something in it that opened me up.\"[9] The couple then became a band and, while they considered calling themselves Bazooka and Soda Powder,[18] they settled on the White Stripes.[19] Jack explained the name's origin:Meg loves peppermints, and we were going to call ourselves the Peppermints. But since our last name was White, we decided to call it the White Stripes. It revolved around this childish idea, the ideas kids have\u2014because they are so much better than adult ideas, right?\"[20]From the beginning, they established certain motifs: publicly pretending to be brother and sister,[21] outfitting their production in only black, red, and white,[22] and heavily using the number \"three\".[23] White has explained that they used these colors to distract from the fact that they were young, white musicians playing \"black music\".[24] They were also noted for their lack of a bass player, and their general refusal to be interviewed separately.[3][23]The White Stripes had their first live performance on August 14, 1997, at the Gold Dollar bar in Detroit.[25] They began their career as part of the Michigan underground garage rock scene, playing with local bands such as the Hentchmen, the Dirtbombs, the Gories, and Rocket 455.[26] In 1998, Dave Buick\u2014owner of an independent, Detroit-based, garage-punk label called Italy Records\u2014approached the band at a bar and asked if they would like to record a single.[27] Jack initially declined, believing it would be too expensive, but he eventually reconsidered when he realized that Buick was offering to pay for it.[28] Their debut single, \"Let's Shake Hands,\" was released on vinyl in February 1998 with an initial pressing of 1,000 copies.[29] This was followed in October 1998 by the single \"Lafayette Blues\" which, again, was only released on vinyl with 1,000 copies.[30]In 1999, the White Stripes signed with the California-based label Sympathy for the Record Industry.[31][22] In March 1999, they released the single \"The Big Three Killed My Baby\", followed by their debut album, The White Stripes, on June 15, 1999.[31]The self-titled debut was produced by Jack and engineered by American music producer Jim Diamond at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit.[32] The album was dedicated to the seminal Mississippi Delta blues musician Son House, an artist who influenced Jack.[23][33]The track \"Cannon\" from The White Stripes contains part of an a cappella version, as performed by House, of the traditional American gospel blues song \"John the Revelator\". The White Stripes also covered House's song \"Death Letter\" on their follow-up album De Stijl.Looking back on their debut during a 2003 interview with Guitar Player, Jack said, \"I still feel we've never topped our first album. It's the most raw, the most powerful, and the most Detroit-sounding record we've made.\"[34]Allmusic said of the album:[31]Jack White's voice is a singular, evocative combination of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.At the end of 1999, the White Stripes released \"Hand Springs\" as a 7\" split single with fellow Detroit band the Dirtbombs on the B-side. 2,000 copies came free with the pinball fanzine Multiball. The record is currently\u2014like the majority of vinyl records by the White Stripes\u2014out of print and difficult to find.Jack and Meg divorced in March 2000.[35] The White Stripes were scheduled to perform at a local music lounge soon after they separated. Jack assumed the band was over and asked Buick and nephew Ben Blackwell to perform with him in the slot that had been booked for the White Stripes. However, the day they were supposed to perform, Meg convinced Jack that the White Stripes should continue and the band reunited.[36] The White Stripes' second album, De Stijl (Dutch for \"The Style\"), was released on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label on June 20, 2000.[37] Considered a cult classic[38] and self-recorded on an 8-track analog tape in Jack's living room,[39][40] De Stijl displays the simplicity of the band's blues and \"scuzzy garage rock\" fusion prior to their breakthrough success.[41]The album title derives from the Dutch art movement of the same name;[41] common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white.[23] The White Stripes cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design as a source of inspiration for their own musical image and presentation.[42] The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, as well as to the influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.[43]Party of Special Things to Do was released as a 7\" on Sub Pop in December 2000.[44] It comprised three songs originally performed by Captain Beefheart, an experimental blues rock musician.De Stijl eventually reached number 38 on Billboard Magazine's Independent Albums chart in 2002, around the time the White Stripes' popularity began establishing itself. One New York Times critic at the time said that the Stripes typified \"what many hip rock fans consider real music.\"[45] The song \"Why Can't You Be Nicer to Me?\" was used in The Simpsons episode \"Judge Me Tender\".The White Stripes' third album, White Blood Cells, was released on July 3, 2001, on Sympathy for the Record Industry.[46] The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records.[47] Its stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making the White Stripes one of the most acclaimed bands of 2002.[25][47]Several outlets praised their \"back to basics\" approach,[48][49] with Daily Mirror calling them \"the greatest band since The Sex Pistols.\"[50] In 2002, Q magazine listed the White Stripes as one of \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\".[51] After their first appearance on network TV (a live set on The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn), Joe Hagan of the New York Times declared, \"They have made rock rock again by returning to its origins as a simple, primitive sound full of unfettered zeal.\"[52] White Blood Cells peaked at number 61 on the Billboard 200, reaching Gold record status by selling over 500,000 albums. It reached number 55 in the United Kingdom,[citation needed] being bolstered in both countries by the single \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" and its accompanying Lego-animation music video directed by Michel Gondry.[3] The video won three awards at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards: Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Editing, and the band played the song live at the event.[17] It was also nominated for Video of the Year, but fell short of winning.[53] Stylus Magazine rated White Blood Cells as the fourteenth greatest album of 2000\u20132005,[54] while Pitchfork Media ranked it eighth on their list of the top 100 albums from 2000 to 2004.[55]In 2002, George Roca produced and directed a concert film about the band titled Nobody Knows How to Talk to Children.[56] It chronicles the White Stripes' four-night stand at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission.[57] According to the band, the film was \"not up to the standards our fans have come to expect\";[57] even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg.[58]\"We had no business being in the mainstream. We assumed the music we were making was private, in a way. We were from the scenario where there are fifty people in every town. Something about us was beyond our control, though. Now it's five hundred people, now it's a second night, what is going on? Is everybody out of their minds?\"\u2014Jack White in a 2017 interview with The New Yorker[22]The White Stripes' fourth album, Elephant, was recorded in 2002 over the span of two weeks with British recording engineer Liam Watson at his Toe Rag Studios in London.[59] Jack self-produced the album with antiquated equipment, including a duct-taped 8-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear.[59] It was released in 2003 on V2 in the US, and on XL Recordings in England.[22][60] It marked the band's major label debut and was their first UK chart-topping album, as well as their first US Top 10 album (at number six).[22] The album eventually reached double platinum certification in Britain,[61] and platinum certification in the United States.[62]Elephant garnered critical acclaim upon its release.[25] It received a perfect five-out-of-five-star rating from Rolling Stone magazine, and enjoys a 92-percent positive rating on Metacritic.[63][64] Allmusic said the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid, and stunning than its predecessor... Darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells.\"[65] Elephant was notable for Jack's first guitar solos, and Rolling Stone placed him at number 17 on its list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[66] That same year, Elephant was ranked number 390 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[67] In 2009, the album came in at number 18 in NME's \"Top 100 Greatest Albums of the decade\". NME referred to the album as the pinnacle of the White Stripes' time as a band and one of Jack White's best works of his career.[68][69]The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful and topped the Billboard rock charts.[70] Its success was followed with a cover of Burt Bacharach's \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\". The album's third single was the successful \"The Hardest Button to Button\". \"There's No Home for You Here\" was the fourth single. In 2004, the album won a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, while \"Seven Nation Army\" won a Grammy for Best Rock Song.In 2005, Jack began working on songs for the band's next album at his home.[71] He played with different techniques than in past albums, trading in his electric guitar for an acoustic on all but a few of the tracks, as his trademark riff-based lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach.[citation needed] The White Stripes' fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was released in 2005 on the V2 label.[72] The title is an allusion to a Biblical quotation Jesus made to the Apostle Simon Peter from the Gospel of Matthew 16:23 of the New Testament (in the King James Version, the quotation is slightly different: \"Get thee behind me, Satan\"[73]). Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce's story collection \"Dubliners\" (published 1914) and used a line from the final story \"The Dead\" to title this album.  The title is also a direct quotation from Who bassist John Entwistle\u2019s solo song \"You\u2019re Mine\".With its reliance on piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba on \"The Nurse\" and \"Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)\", Get Behind Me Satan did not feature the explicit blues and punk styles that dominated earlier White Stripes albums.[according to whom?] However, despite this, the band was critically lauded for their \"fresh, arty reinterpretations of their classic inspirations.\"[72] It has garnered positive reactions from fans, as well as critical acclaim, receiving more Grammy nominations as well as making them one of the must-see acts of the decade.[74][75] Rolling Stone ranked it the third best album of the year[76] and it received the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2006.Three singles were released from the album, the first being \"Blue Orchid\", a popular song on satellite radio and some FM stations.[citation needed] The second and third singles were \"My Doorbell\" and \"The Denial Twist\", respectively, and music videos were made for the three singles. \"My Doorbell\" was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.The White Stripes postponed the Japanese leg of their world tour after Jack strained his vocal cords, with doctors recommending that Jack not sing or talk for two weeks.[77] After a full recovery, he returned to the stage in Auckland, New Zealand to headline the Big Day Out tour.[72][78] While on the British leg of the tour, Jack changed his name from Jack White to \"Three quid\".The White Stripes released a cover version of Tegan and Sara's song \"Walking with a Ghost\" on iTunes in November 2005. The song was later released in December as the Walking with a Ghost EP featuring four other live tracks. In October 2006, it was announced on the official White Stripes website that there would be an album of avant-garde orchestral recordings consisting of past music written by Jack called Aluminium. The album was made available for pre-order on November 6, 2006, to great demand from the band's fans; the LP version of the project sold out in a little under a day. The project was conceived by Richard Russell, founder of XL Recordings, who co-produced the album with Joby Talbot.[79] It was recorded between August 2005 and February 2006 at Intimate Studios in Wapping, London using an orchestra. Before the album went out of print, it was available exclusively through the Aluminium website in a numbered limited edition of 3,333 CDs with 999 LPs.[80]On January 12, 2007, V2 Records announced that, due to being under the process of reconstruction, it would no longer release new White Stripes material, leaving the band without a label.[81] However, as the band's contract with V2 had already expired, on February 12, 2007, it was confirmed that the band had signed a single album deal with Warner Bros. Records.[82]The White Stripes' sixth album, Icky Thump, was released on June 19, 2007, on Warner Bros. Records.[3][83] This was their first record with Warner Bros., since V2 closed in 2006, and it was released on a one-album contract.[84] Icky Thump entered the UK Albums Chart at number one,[85] and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 223,000 copies sold.[85][86] By late July, Icky Thump was certified gold in the United States. As of March 8, 2008, the album has sold 725,125 copies in the US. On February 10, 2008, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.Following the well-received Get Behind Me Satan, Icky Thump marked a return to the punk, garage rock and blues influences for which the band is known.[3] It was recorded at Nashville's Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record\u2014the longest of any White Stripes album. It would also be their first album with a title track. The album's release came on the heels of a series of concerts in Europe and one in North America at Bonnaroo.[87][88]Prior to the album's release, three tracks were previewed to NME: \"Icky Thump\", \"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told)\" and \"Conquest\". NME described the tracks as \"an experimental, heavy sounding 70s riff,\" \"a strong, melodic love song\" and \"an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section,\" respectively.[89] On the US Billboard Charts dated May 12, 2007, \"Icky Thump\"\u2014the first single\u2014became the band's first Top 40 single, charting at number 26, and later charted at number 2 in the UK.On April 25, 2007, the duo announced that they would embark on a tour of Canada, performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: \"Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to the far reaches of the Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, the White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary.\" Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related.[90] It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.[91]On June 24, 2007, just a few hours before their concert at Deer Lake Park, the White Stripes began their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets,[18] such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by frequent \"secret shows\" publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario,[18] Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a famous one-note show on George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's.[92] Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube.[93] As well, the band filmed its video for \"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told)\" in Iqaluit.After the conclusion of the Canadian dates, they embarked on a brief U.S. leg of their tour, which was to be followed by a break before more shows in the fall.[18] But before their last show\u2014in Southaven, Mississippi\u2014Ben Blackwell (Jack's nephew and the group's archivist) says that Meg approached him and said, \"This is the last White Stripes show\". He asked if she meant of the tour, but she responded, \"No. I think this is the last show, period.\"[18] On September 11, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg's struggle with acute anxiety.[77] A few days later, the duo cancelled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well.[94]The band was on hiatus from late 2007 to early 2011. While on hiatus, Jack formed a group called The Dead Weather (featuring himself, Jack Lawrence, Dean Fertita, and Alison Mosshart), although he insisted that the White Stripes remained his top priority.[95] The White Stripes performed live for the first time since September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009, where they performed an alternate version of \"We're Going to Be Friends\".[96] This proved to be their final live performance as a band.In 2009 he reported that the White Stripes were working on their seventh album.[97][98] In an article dated May 6, 2009 with MusicRadar.com, Jack mentioned recording songs with Meg before the Conan gig had taken place, saying, \"We had recorded a couple of songs at the new studio.\" About a new White Stripes album, Jack said, \"It won't be too far off. Maybe next year.\" Jack also explained Meg's acute anxiety during the Stripes' last tour, saying, \"I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg had come from a dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person. To go full-speed from a dead-halt is overwhelming, and we had to take a break.\"[99]A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009.[100] The film (directed by Emmett Malloy) documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage.[101] Jack and Meg White appeared at the premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto.[citation needed] The tour was in support of the album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province.[102] Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories.[103] Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia,[102] and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing at the conclusion of the concert. The film was directed by a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy.[104] A second feature, Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.In an interview with Self Titled, Jack alluded to the creation of a White Stripes film to be released later in 2009.[105] In an interview with contactmusic.com, Jack claimed that working with the White Stripes would be \"strange\". \"It would definitely be strange to go into the White Stripes again and have to rethink my game,\" adding: \"But that would be the best thing about it, because it would be a whole new White Stripes.\"[106]In 2010, a Super Bowl ad by the U.S. Air Force Reserve caused the White Stripes to \"take strong insult and objection to the Air Force Reserve presenting this advertisement with the implication that we licensed one of our songs to encourage recruitment during a war that we do not support.\"[107] The Air Force Reserve denied that the song was from the White Stripes and the music was scored by an advertising agency for the commercial.In November 2010, the White Stripes contributed a previously released cover version of the song \"Rated X\" to the compilation album Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn.[108] In late 2010, the White Stripes reissued their first three albums on Third Man Records on a 180-gram vinyl along with 500 limited-edition, \"split-colored\" records to accompany it.[clarification needed] Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair. He said, \"We thought we'd do a lot of things that we'd never done: a full tour of Canada, a documentary, coffee-table book, live album, a boxed set\u00a0... Now that we've gotten a lot of that out of our system, Meg and I can get back in the studio and start fresh.\"[109]On February 2, 2011, the duo announced that they had officially ceased recording and performing music as the White Stripes. The announcement specifically denied any artistic differences or health issues, but cited \"a myriad of reasons ... mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band\".[110][111]In a 2014 interview, Jack said that Meg's lack of enthusiasm for the project contributed to the band's breakup.[112] White told Rolling Stone that \"she viewed me that way of 'Oh, big deal, you did it, so what?' Almost every single moment of the White Stripes was like that. We'd be working in the studio and something amazing would happen: I'm like, 'Damn, we just broke into a new world right there!' And Meg's sitting in silence.\"[113]The White Stripes have been described as garage rock,[114][115] blues rock,[114] alternative rock,[115] punk blues,[116] \nand indie rock.[117] They emerged from Detroit's active garage rock revival scene of the late 1990s and early 2000s.[17] Their contemporaries included bands such as The Von Bondies, The Dirtbombs, The Detroit Cobras, and other bands that Jack included on a compilation album called Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit, which was recorded in his living room.[17]The band was influenced by blues musicians including Son House, Blind Willie McTell and Robert Johnson, garage rock bands such as The Gories and The Sonics,[118] the Detroit protopunk sound of bands like the MC5 and The Stooges, in addition to groups like The Cramps, The Velvet Underground, and the early Los Angeles punk blues band The Gun Club. Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and the roots of the band's music, stating that he feels it is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of The Gun Club's music in particular, Jack said, \"'Sex Beat', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', and 'For The Love Of Ivy'...why are these songs not taught in schools?\"[119] Heavy blues rock bands such as AC/DC and Led Zeppelin have also influenced the band, as Jack has claimed that he \"can't trust anybody who doesn't like Led Zeppelin.\"[120]Traditional country music such as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn,[9] rockabilly acts like the Flat Duo Jets,[9] Wanda Jackson and Gene Vincent, the surf rock of Dick Dale, and folk music like Lead Belly and Bob Dylan have also influenced the band's sound.[121] Meg has said one of her all-time favorite musicians is Bob Dylan;[122] Jack has performed live with him, and has claimed \"I've got three fathers\u2014my biological dad, God and Bob Dylan\".[123]The White Stripes were notable for having only two musicians, limiting the instruments they could play live.[124] Jack, the principal writer, said that this was not a problem, and that he \"always centered the band around the number three. Everything was vocals, guitar and drums or vocals, piano and drums.\"[9] Fans and critics drew comparisons between Jack's prowess on the guitar and Meg's simplistic, reserved drumming.[45]Early on, the band drew attention for their preference for antiquated recording equipment. In a 2001 New York Times concert reviews, Ann Powers noted that Jack's \"ingenious\" playing was \"constrained by [Meg's] deliberately undeveloped approach,\" and that \"he created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a less-than-high-quality solid body electric.\"[45]With few exceptions, Jack displayed a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s.[47] Jack used a number of effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar.[125] When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets.[126] In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.White also played other instruments such as a black F-Style Gibson mandolin, Rhodes bass keys, and a Steinway piano. He played a custom-made red and white marimba on \"The Nurse\", \"Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)\" as well as on the non-album tracks \"Who's A Big Baby\" and \"Top Special\".Meg's minimalistic drumming style was a prominent part of the band's sound. Meg never had formal drum lessons. She played Ludwig Drums with Paiste cymbals, and says her pre-show warm-up consisted of \"whiskey and Red Bull.\"[127] Jack downplayed criticisms of her style, insisting:\"I never thought 'God, I wish Neil Peart was in this band.' It's kind of funny: When people critique hip hop, they're scared to open up, for fear of being called racist. But they're not scared to open up on female musicians, out of pure sexism. Meg is the best part of this band. It never would have worked with anybody else, because it would have been too complicated... It was my doorway to playing the blues.\"[9]Of her playing style, Meg herself said:\"I appreciate other kinds of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realize that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [Jack] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him.\"[127]Although Jack was the lead vocalist, Meg did sing lead vocals on four of the band's songs: \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" (from Elephant),[125] \"Passive Manipulation\" (from Get Behind Me Satan), \"Who's a Big Baby?\" (released on the \"Blue Orchid\" single), and \"St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)\" (from Icky Thump). She also accompanied Jack on the songs \"Your Southern Can Is Mine\" from their album De Stijl, \"Hotel Yorba\" and \"This Protector\" from their album White Blood Cells, on \"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told)\" and \"Rag & Bone\" from their album Icky Thump, \"Rated X\" and also sang alongside Jack and Holly Golightly on the song \"It's True That We Love One Another\", from the album Elephant.Jack and Meg White appeared in Jim Jarmusch's film Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, in a segment entitled \"Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil\".[128] This particular segment contains extensions of White Stripes motifs such as childhood innocence and Nikola Tesla.[128] In 2004, the band released its first music film Under Blackpool Lights, which was shot entirely on super 8 film and was directed by Dick Carruthers.[129][130]The band also appeared as themselves in The Simpsons episode \"Jazzy and the Pussycats\" in 2006.[131] Jack is one of three guitarists featured in the 2009 documentary It Might Get Loud, and Meg appears in segments that include the White Stripes.[132]The Academy Award-winning movie, The Social Network featured \"Ball and Biscuit\" in the opening scene.[133]The song \"Apple Blossom\" was featured in the Quentin Tarantino film The Hateful Eight.[134]Several songs by the White Stripes are featured in the first season of the television series Peaky Blinders.The song \"Little Ghost\" appears in the post credits scene for the 2012 Laika studios film, ParaNorman.[135]Several White Stripes recordings were completed rapidly. For example, Elephant was recorded in about two weeks in London's Toe Rag Studio.[25] Their 2005 follow-up, Get Behind Me Satan, was likewise recorded in just two weeks.For live shows, the White Stripes were known for Jack's employment of heavy distortion, as well as audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.[136]In 2007, British choreographer Wayne McGregor used music by the White Stripes for his production Chroma, a piece he created for The Royal Ballet in London, England.[137] The orchestral arrangements for Chroma were commissioned by Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, as a gift to the White Stripes and were produced by the British classical composer Joby Talbot. Three of these songs, \"The Hardest Button To Button\", \"Aluminium\" and \"Blue Orchid\", were first played to the band as a surprise in Cincinnati Music Hall, Ohio. McGregor heard the orchestral versions and decided to create a ballet using the music. Talbot re-orchestrated the music for the Royal Opera House orchestra, also writing three additional pieces of his own composition. The world premiere of the ballet took place on November 16, 2006, at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. The ballet subsequently won the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production.The White Stripes had a carefully constructed image built around lore they created for themselves and visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted to put its green logo on the CD.[18] Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media.Early in their career, the band provided various descriptions of their relationship. Jack claimed that he and Meg were siblings, the youngest two of ten.[17] As the story went, they became a band when, on Bastille Day 1997, Meg went to the attic of their parents' home and began to play on Jack's drum kit.[17] This claim was widely believed and repeated despite rumors that they were, or had been, husband and wife.[138][139] In 2001, proof of their 1996 marriage emerged,[140][141] as well as evidence that the couple had divorced in March 2000, just before the band gained widespread attention.[142][143] Even so, they continued to insist publicly that they were brother and sister.[18] In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jack claimed that this open secret was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couple's relationship:When you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, you think, 'Oh, I see...' When they're brother and sister, you go, 'Oh, that's interesting.' You care more about the music, not the relationship\u2014whether they're trying to save their relationship by being in a band.[9]\"The White Stripes' colors were always red, white, and black. It came from peppermint candy. I also think they are the most powerful color combination of all time, from a Coca-Cola can to a Nazi banner. Those colors strike chords with people. In Japan, they are honorable colors. When you see a bride in a white gown, you immediately see innocence in that. Red is anger and passion. It is also sexual. And black is the absence of all that.\"\u2014Jack White, Rolling Stone magazine, September 8, 2005.[9]The White Stripes made exclusive use of a red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances;[9] Meg said that \"like a uniform at school, you can just focus on what you're doing because everybody's wearing the same thing.\"[23] Jack also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor.[17] Spin magazine commented that \"his songs\u2014about getting married in cathedrals, walking to kindergarten, and guileless companionship\u2014are performed with an almost naive certitude.\"[144] Other affectations included Jack using two microphones onstage.[45]The media and fans alike varied between intrigue and skepticism at the band's appearance and presentation. Andy Gershon, president of the V2 label at the time of their signing, was reluctant to sign them, saying, \"They need a bass player, they've got this red-and-white gimmick, and the songs are fantastic, but they've recorded very raw...how is this going to be on radio?\"[17] In a 2002 Spin magazine article, Chuck Klosterman wondered, \"how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing Dr. Seuss clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?\"[17] However, in 2001, Benjamin Nugent with TIME magazine commented that \"it's hard to begrudge [Jack] his right to nudge the spotlight toward his band, and away from his private life, by any means available. Even at the expense of the truth.\"[145]On October 2, 2005, Jim Diamond\u2014the owner and operator of Ghetto Recorders recording studio\u2014filed a lawsuit against the band and Third Man Records for \"breach of contract\".[146] In the suit, he claimed that as the co-producer, mixer, and editor on the band's debut album, and mixer and engineer on De Stijl, he was due royalties for \"mechanical rights\".[146][147] The band filed a counterclaim on May 16 of that year, requesting damages against Diamond and an official court declaration denying him rights to the material.[146] Diamond lost the suit, with the jury determining that he was not instrumental in crafting the band's sound.[147]Dominique Payette, a Quebecois radio host, sued the band for $70,000 in 2008 for sampling 10 seconds of her radio show in the song \"Jumble Jumble\" without permission.[148] The matter was ultimately settled out of court.[149]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Green_Day": "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.Though the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9!, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the  Billboard 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers, was released on February 7, 2020.Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide.[1] The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording.In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have also collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, The Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot, The Coverups, and have worked on solo careers.In 1987, friends and guitarists Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, along with bassist Sean Hughes and drummer Raj Punjabi, formed a band under the name Sweet Children.[2][3][4] One of their first songs written together was \"Best Thing in Town\".[5] The group's first live performance took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California.[6] In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\", who replaced original drummer Raj Punjabi.[7] It was also around this time that bassist Sean Hughes left the band, causing Dirnt to switch from guitar to bass. Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, who would later contact Armstrong to fill in as a possible second guitarist for their band Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band.[8][9]In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label.[10] In April 1989, the band released its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours.[11] Shortly before the EP's release, the group dropped the Sweet Children name; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.[12] The band adopted the name Green Day, due to the members' fondness for cannabis.[13][14][15] The phrase, \"Green day\", was slang in the Bay Area, where the band originated, for spending a day doing nothing but smoking marijuana.[16] Armstrong once admitted in 2001 that he considered it to be \"the worst band name in the world\".[17]Lookout! released Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990.[18] Green Day recorded two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records.[19] In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours.[20] In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Kiffmeyer left the East Bay area to attend Humboldt State University in Arcata, California.[6][21] The Lookouts' drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent, which Kiffmeyer \"graciously accepted\".[22] The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe.[23] The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S.[23] Green Day supported another California punk band, Bad Religion, as an opening act for their Recipe for Hate Tour for most of 1993.[24]Kerplunk's underground success led to interest from some major record labels and a bidding war to sign Green Day.[25] The band eventually left Lookout! and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo.[26] The group was impressed by his work with the fellow Californian band The Muffs and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could talk to and connect with\".[26] Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\"[27] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major-label debut, Dookie.Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,[28] Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies in the US.[29] At a performance on September 9, 1994, at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested.[30] The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where the group started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth.[31] Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition.[26] In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year.[32][33]In 1995, a single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\".[34] The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.[35] The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995.[36] Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie.[26] The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"[37] The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\".Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold three million copies in the United States.[38] The album earned the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly canceled a European tour, citing exhaustion.[39]After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on its next album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums.[40] The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, hardcore, surf rock, ska, and the acoustic ballad, \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\".[41][42] Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The mainstream success of \"Good Riddance\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video.[43] The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER.[42]The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\".[44][45] The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill, which aired in 1997.[46] In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod.[47][48] In 1999, guitarist Jason White began supporting the band during concerts as a rhythm guitarist.[49]In 2000, Green Day released their folk punk-inspired sixth studio album Warning.[50] In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. In November 2000, the band performed for free on the steps on San Francisco's City Hall to protest the eviction of artists from the city in a show produced by Ian Brennan.[51] The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.[52] AllMusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"[53] Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\"[54] Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,[52] and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least triple platinum, Warning was only certified gold.[55]At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards for which the group was nominated.[56] The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.[57]The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning.[58][59] International Superhits! and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!.[60] Shenanigans contained some of the band's B-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.[56]In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182, which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.[61]In the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record material for an album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines.[62] After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work.[63] It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information.[64][65] After the band, who concealed their identities with masks and costumes,[66] released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds.[67] However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.[67] The bands \"feuded\" via press releases and statements from Armstrong.[66][68] Several journalists openly referred to the group as a Green Day side project,[69][70][71][72] although it was not confirmed as such until 2013.[73]Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot\". The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\".[74] The album depicts modern American life under the control of an idiot ruler who lets people be misinformed by the media and a \"redneck agenda\". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders.[75] Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art.[76] American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven out of eight awards for which the group was nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2005.[77] The album went on to sell 6 million copies in the US.[55]In 2005, American Idiot won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and was nominated in six other categories including Album of the Year.[78][79] The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards it was nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" video won six of those awards. A year later, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year.[80] In 2009, Kerrang! named American Idiot the best album of the decade,[81] NME ranked it number 60 in a similar list,[82] and Rolling Stone ranked it 22nd.[83] Rolling Stone also listed \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and \"American Idiot\" among the 100 best songs of the 2000s, at number 65 and 47, respectively.[84][85] In 2005, the album was ranked number 420 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.[86] In 2012, the album was ranked number 225 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[87]While touring for American Idiot, the group filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England.[88][89] These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005.[88][89] The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show.[88][89] The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17, respectively.[90]On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands.[91] On January 10, 2006, the band was awarded a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band.[92]Green Day engaged in many other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. In 2008, the group released a garage rock-inspired album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! The Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour during the same year to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.[93]In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album.[94] The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube.[95] The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.[96]21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.[97][98] The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars.[99][100] After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date.[101] The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. These were the group's first live shows in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.[102] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010.[32] As of December 2010, 21st Century Breakdown has sold 1,005,000 copies in the US.[103]Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\"[104][105]In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.[106][107] American Idiot opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009.[106] The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son.[107] On April 20, 2010, American Idiot opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 iTunes released \"When It's Time\" as a single.[108]During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.[109][110]During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band members stated that they were writing new material.[111] In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form.\"[112] The band members also stated that the group was recording a live album of the tour, featuring the previously unreleased song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that the group had completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album would \"most likely\" be released.[113] The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.[114][115]During the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! which would be released in the fall of 2012.[116][117] The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band.[118] That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.[119][120]\u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012, respectively, and were met with generally positive reviews from critics, though fans were more lukewarm towards the albums. On January 22, 2013, the band announced that \u00a1Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013.[121] Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy.[122] On March 10, 2013, Green Day began its 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy.[123] In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold.[124] The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on the tour's European leg, including during the Reading Festival 2013 headline show.[125]Demolicious, a compilation album that contains alternate versions and demos of songs from \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called \"State of Shock\" and an acoustic version of \"Stay the Night\", from \u00a1Uno!.[126]Green Day performed its first concert in a year on April 16, 2015. The group first played a set as Sweet Children with John Kiffmeyer, followed by a set as Green Day.[127] On April 18, 2015, Green Day were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Fall Out Boy.[128]On April 24, 2015, Rob Cavallo revealed Green Day were recording a twelfth studio album. Cavallo claimed to have heard \"five new songs that Billie has written and demoed\", and that the fans should be \"sure that when they do return, the music will be amazing\".[129] On December 24, 2015, Green Day released a Christmas song, \"Xmas Time of the Year\".[130]On August 11, 2016, Green Day released the first single, \"Bang Bang\",[131] from the group's album Revolution Radio, which was released on October 7, 2016.[132] Likely due to his tonsil cancer diagnosis, Jason White decided to return to his role as a touring member and did not participate in the album's recording sessions.[133][failed verification] The band went on a world tour supporting the album.[134] In November 2016, the band performed at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles and made a political statement about the then-recent US election of Donald Trump by chanting \"No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA\" during their rendition of \"Bang Bang\".[135]Aaron Burgess at Alternative Press observed, \"It's the first time in years Green Day haven't had all the answers. But as a statement on how it feels to fight, it's the closest to the truth they've ever gotten.\"[136] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian stated \"[after their last few albums] the band have decided to get back to basics: Revolution Radio is their most focused work in years. Lead single Bang Bang sets the tone, with a caustic consideration of the fame-hungry psychosis of a mass shooter.[137]The band released their second greatest hits compilation, God's Favorite Band, on November 17, 2017. It contains 20 of their hits, along with two new tracks: a different version of the Revolution Radio track \"Ordinary World\", featuring country singer Miranda Lambert, and a previously unreleased song titled \"Back in the USA\".[138]On April 13, 2019, for Record Store Day, the band released their Woodstock 1994 performance on vinyl for the first time. It contains all 9 songs they played live, as well as audio of the ensuing mud fight.[139] On September 10, 2019, the band announced the Hella Mega Tour with Fall Out Boy and Weezer as headliners alongside themselves, with The Interrupters as the opening act. They also released the single, \"Father of All...\" off their thirteenth album, Father of All Motherfuckers.[140] The same day, in an interview with KROQ, Armstrong announced the band would be parting ways with Reprise after the album's release, as they were off their contract with Warner.[141] On September 30, 2019, Green Day signed a two-year agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL).[142] The album's second single, \"Fire, Ready, Aim\", was released on October 9, 2019.[143][144] The album's third single, \"Oh Yeah!\", was released on January 16, 2020.[145] The album was released on February 7, 2020.[146] The album's fourth single, \"Meet Me on the Roof\", was released on the same day as the album.[147]On April 6, 2020, Armstrong revealed that he had written six songs intending to record new music with the band once the COVID-19 pandemic had passed.[148] On May 21, 2020, the band released a cover of Blondie's \"Dreaming\".[149]On October 30, 2020, the band's secret side project, The Network, teased upcoming activity with a video entitled \"The Prophecy\" and mentioned their upcoming sequel album.[150] Then on November 2, 2020, the Network released a music video for their first song in 17 years, named \"Ivankkka Is a Nazi\".[151] After a couple of weeks of small hints on social media, as well as Green Day claiming they were not The Network, the band released an EP on November 20, 2020, titled Trans Am. On December 4, 2020, The Network released their second album Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!.[152]In February 2021, Green Day announced a single, titled \"Here Comes the Shock\", which was later released on February 21, 2021.[153] The band would release a remastered version of Insomniac in March for the belated 25th anniversary of the album's release, with bonus live tracks.[154] On May 17, 2021, Green Day released the single \"Pollyanna\".[155] On November 5, 2021, Green Day released the single \"Holy Toledo!\".[156]BBC Sessions, the fourth live album by Green Day, was released on December 10, 2021. On December 18, 2021 they put out a teaser video with the captions \"RAK Studios. London, England. Green Day. 1972\".[157]Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Dickies, and Buzzcocks.[39] Stylistically, the band is primarily characterized as punk rock,[158][159][160][161][162][163][164] pop-punk,[162][163][165][166][167] and alternative rock.[167][168][169][170] The band has casually explored other musical styles including skate punk,[171] power pop,[162] post-punk,[172] pop rock,[163] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\"[166] While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help.[173] Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal hardcore-turned alternative rock bands H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs.[39] Green Day has covered H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a B-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in the group's song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name.[174]Among other influences, Green Day have also cited the Kinks, the Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick.[175][176][177] English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with its song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".[178] Green Day has cited Operation Ivy as a big influence.[8][9] In August 1996, Billie Joe Armstrong told Guitar World he \"can remember a few different instances\" of when he first discovered punk rock: \"There were these two guys who introduced me to things like D.O.A. and the Dead Kennedys. Then, in the seventh grade, there was a girl at school who would bring in records like T.S.O.L. and say, 'Here, listen to this.'\"[39] Armstrong said he thinks he \"really started getting into\" punk rock \"in 1987 with Turn It Around!, a double seven-inch compilation record put out by [punk fanzine] Maximumrocknroll.\"[39] Armstrong cited Turn It Around! as an influence, calling it \"a pretty big record\" for him.[179] Tr\u00e9 Cool as stated that the band is influenced by music that they didn't like, he stated artists like Hall & Oates, Cyndi Lauper and other 1980s music.[180]Although Green Day has been compared to the Buzzcocks, the Ramones and the Clash, Mike Dirnt said he had never heard the Buzzcocks when Green Day began.[39] Dirnt said: \"First off, you can't sound like any of those bands. And secondly, those are probably the last ones in my record collection.\"[39] Armstrong responded to Dirnt, saying: \"Mine too. Those are all bands I got into later.\"[39] The Dickies is another band Green Day has been compared to.[39] Dirnt said he \"never owned a Dickies album, although\" he \"did see\" the Dickies live \"around the time of\" Kerplunk!. Dirnt said \"by that time, we'd played so many shows it had no bearing.\"[39] Armstrong referred to the Dickies as \"just another Ramones rip-off\".[39] Although in August 1996, Armstrong said bands like the Ramones are bands he listened to later, in June 2010, Armstrong cited the Ramones as an influence. He also said his \"range of favorite songwriters goes anywhere from the Sex Pistols to Lennon\u2013McCartney.[179] During the American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown era of Green Day, the band was influenced by The Who, U2, Motown albums, and musicals such as Grease.[181]The band's 1991 album Kerplunk is one of the best-selling independent albums of all time, selling over 4.5 million copies worldwide.[182] It was also listed in 100 greatest indie albums by Blender in 2007.[183]Green Day is credited (alongside Sublime, The Offspring, and Rancid) with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States,[184][185][186][187] particularly with the album Dookie,[188][189][190] which was cited by Fuse as the most important pop-punk album of all time and named the best alternative album of 1994 by Rolling Stone.[191][192] It was also placed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"Definitive 200\" list of 200 classic albums.[193] Both Dookie and American Idiot appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[194][195] In 2011, they were voted best punk rock band of all time by Rolling Stone.[196] Diffuser.fm listed Dookie as the greatest album of the 90s.[197]Green Day has sold more than 90 million records worldwide making them one of the highest-selling artists of all time.[198] The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording.In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards:[199][200] The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, their first year of eligibility.[201]The band has been cited as an influence by a variety of artists, including Avril Lavigne,[202] Fall Out Boy,[203] Blink-182,[204] Lady Gaga,[205] Wavves,[206] Fidlar,[206] Tegan and Sara,[206] Bowling for Soup[207][208][209] and Sum 41.[210]Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White and The Longshot with Jeff Matika, The Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and friends in which all members play under fake stage names.[211] Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows.[212] In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called The Boo which recorded a one-off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store. Since January 2018, Armstrong, Dirnt and White have played in the band The Coverups along with Green Day audio engineer Chris Dugan and tour manager Bill Schneider. The band sporadically performs one-off shows, usually in small clubs, and cover the songs of classic rock and alternative rock bands such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Clash, and Nirvana.[213][214][215]In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by the Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster.[216] In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.[217][218]Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where the band performs the show's theme song; Green Day's version was released as a single on July 23, 2007.[219][220][221][222]In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director Michael Mayer to adapt the group's rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\".[223]Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking [and] musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers\u2014for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\"[224] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits\u2014it's a global knockout.\"[225] The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for several Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by the group's manager Pat Magnarella.[226] He explained in an interview that \"[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\"[227] For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\"[228]On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed.[229] Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. However, in February 2020, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed to NME that plans for a film adaptation of the stage musical had been \"pretty much scrapped\", without providing any more details as to the reason.[230]On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released.[231][non-primary source needed] Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013.[232] The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.[233]Green Day served as executive producers of Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk (2017), an extensive documentary film about the San Francisco Bay area punk scene from the late 1970s to the 1990s.[234]Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes \"true punk\".[235] In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former frontman of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented, \"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\"[236] However, others in the punk rock scene would come to the defense of the band on their punk status. Bad Religion lead guitarist Brett Gurewitz and founder of the independent punk label Epitaph Records would state, \"They [Green Day] are a punk band, but you know, punk is the legacy of rock and roll, and Green Day are the biggest band in the genre.\"[237]Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, \"Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money\u2014we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\"[235] In 2021, Armstrong condemned the band's labeling as \"pop-punk\" by critics in a Vulture magazine interview, stating, \"I never really liked that term (pop punk), it turned into sort of a genre. I never thought of myself as a pop artist. I\u2019ve always been left of center. To say you\u2019re a pop-punker \u2026 it never sat well with me.\" Armstrong acknowledged the band's more melodic punk style compared to other bands from the Bay Area scene it emerged out of, but also brought up the band's performance alongside East Bay hardcore bands like Neurosis, Engage, Spitboy, Blatz, and Filth.[238]On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing \"Basket Case\", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled \"1 Minutes Left\", saying \"You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!\" He also told the crowd he \"was not Justin Bieber\" and labeled the festival as a \"joke\". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage.[239] Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that \"Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas\" also adding that Armstrong would be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.[240][241] However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.[242] The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, Revolution Radio.[243][244] They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album Father of All Motherfuckers.[244][245]On July 7, 2017, about 20 minutes before Green Day headlined Mad Cool, a festival in Madrid, an acrobat fell about 30 meters (98\u00a0ft) from a cage above the stage and died. Some fans were upset at the band and festival organizers for continuing the show, which was attended by about 35,000 people.[246] On their website, Armstrong said the band did not know about the accident before their set, and likely would not have played if they had.[247]Current membersCurrent touring musiciansFormer membersFormer touring musiciansTimelineGreen Day has earned 214 award nominations and 92 wins.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Country_music": "Country (also called country and western) is a genre of popular music that originated with blues, church music such as Southern gospel and spirituals, old-time, and American folk music forms including Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, and the cowboy Western music styles of New Mexico, Red Dirt, Tejano, and Texas country. Its popularized roots originate in the Southern and Southwestern United States of the early 1920s.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes (most commonly known as \"Honky Tonk music\") with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies often accompanied by string instruments such as electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), banjos, and fiddles as well as harmonicas.[1][2][3] Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.[4]The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009, in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.[5]The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and blue-collar American life. It has been inspired by American popular music, and American folk music which had its roots in Celtic music, early music of the British Isles, singing cowboys, corrido, ranchera, norte\u00f1o, French folk music, African-American music, and other traditional folk music traditions.The main components of the modern country music style date back to music traditions throughout the Southern United States and Southwestern United States, while its place in American popular music was established in the 1920s during the early days of music recording.[6] Country music was \"introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon.\"[7]Immigrants to the southern Appalachian Mountains, of the Southeastern United States, brought the folk music and instruments of Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin along with them for nearly 300 years, which developed into Appalachian music. As the country expanded westward, the Mississippi River and Louisiana became a crossroads for country music, giving rise to Cajun music. In the Southwestern United States, it was the Rocky Mountains, American frontier, and Rio Grande that acted as a similar backdrop for Native American, Mexican, and cowboy ballads, which resulted in New Mexico music and the development of Western music, and its directly related Red Dirt, Texas country, and Tejano music styles.The U.S. Congress has formally recognized Bristol, Tennessee as the \"Birthplace of Country Music\",[8] based on the historic Bristol recording sessions of 1927.[9][10][11] Since 2014, the city has been home to the Birthplace of Country Music Museum.[12][13] Historians have also noted the influence of the less-known Johnson City sessions of 1928 and 1929,[14][15] and the Knoxville sessions of 1929 and 1930.[16] In addition, the Mountain City Fiddlers Convention, held in 1925, helped to inspire modern country music. Before these, pioneer settlers, in the Great Smoky Mountains region, had developed a rich musical heritage.[17]The first generation emerged in the 1920s, with Atlanta's music scene playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner (1885\u20131960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the Skillet Lickers, was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin' John Carson as early as 1923, followed by Columbia Records (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") (Samantha Bumgarner) in 1924, and RCA Victor Records in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre Jimmie Rodgers, who is widely considered the \"Father of Country Music\", and the first family of country music the Carter Family.[18] Many \"hillbilly\" musicians recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.[19]During the second generation (1930s\u20131940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring the Gene Autry, who was known as king of the \"singing cowboys\",  and Hank Williams. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as Western swing. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[20] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".The third generation (1950s\u20131960s) started at the end of World War II with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass, which emerged when Bill Monroe, along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music remained a popular component of country music. The Native American, Hispano, and American frontier music of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, became popular among poor communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; the basic ensemble consisted of classical guitar, bass guitar, dobro or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured electric guitars, trumpets, keyboards (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of tack piano), banjos, and drums. By the early 1950s it blended with rock and roll, becoming the rockabilly sound produced by Sam Phillips, Norman Petty, and Bob Keane. Musicians like Elvis Presley, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ritchie Valens, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Johnny Cash emerged as enduring representatives of the style. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee; Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the 1950s to the mid-1960s, Western singer-songwriters such as Michael Martin Murphey and Marty Robbins rose in prominence as did others, throughout Western music traditions, like New Mexico music's Al Hurricane. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock.Fourth generation (1970s\u20131980s) music included outlaw country with roots in the Bakersfield sound, and country pop with roots in the countrypolitan, folk music and soft rock. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, Texas country and Tejano music gained popularity with performers like Freddie Fender. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production; this neotraditional movement would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of George Strait. Attempts to combine punk and country were pioneered by Jason and the Scorchers, and in the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk scene with bands like the Long Ryders and Mojo Nixon.During the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as Alan Jackson and the \"King of Country\" himself, George Strait, and the more broadly popular stadium country acts, in particular Garth Brooks. The Chicks became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.The sixth generation (2000s\u2013present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. It has also, however, seen a shift into patriotism and conservative politics since the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, but twenty years later, many are saying the genre is finally starting to move away from that.[21] The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were in the country pop genre, such as those by Lady A, Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, Trixie Mattel, Orville Peck and Taylor Swift.[22] Hip hop also made its mark on country music with the emergence of country rap.[23]The first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"Arkansas Traveler\" and \"Turkey in the Straw\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & A.C. (Eck) Robertson on June 30, 1922, for Victor Records and released in April 1923.[24][25] Columbia Records began issuing records with \"hillbilly\" music (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") as early as 1924.[18]The first commercial recording of what is widely considered to be the first country song featuring vocals and lyrics was Fiddlin' John Carson with \"Little Log Cabin in the Lane\" for Okeh Records on June 14, 1923.[26][27]Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with \"Wreck of the Old 97\".[28][29] The flip side of the record was \"Lonesome Road Blues\", which also became very popular.[30] In April 1924, \"Aunt\" Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs.[31] Many of the early country musicians, such as the yodeler Cliff Carlisle, recorded blues songs into the 1930s.[32] Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Fiddlin' John Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and the Skillet Lickers.[33] The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922, when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast.[34]Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. From Scott County, Virginia, the Carters had learned sight reading of hymnals and sheet music using solfege.[citation needed] Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound recordist.[35][36] A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe.\nRodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk, and many of his best songs were his compositions, including \"Blue Yodel\",[37] which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.[38][39] Beginning in 1927, and for the next 17 years, the Carters recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional tunes, country songs and gospel hymns, all representative of America's southeastern folklore and heritage.[40]Record sales declined during the Great Depression, but radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started by radio stations all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California.The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. Some of the early stars on the Opry were Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country.[41] Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. Moon Mullican, for example, played Western swing but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner Eddy Arnold placed eight songs in the top 10.[42] From 1945 to 1955 Jenny Lou Carson was one of the most prolific songwriters in country music.[43]In the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular singing cowboys from the era were Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Rogers.[44] Country music and western music were frequently played together on the same radio stations, hence the term country and western music, despite Country and Western being two distinct genres.Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. Patsy Montana opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as Western swing. Cliff Bruner, Moon Mullican, Milton Brown and Adolph Hofner were other early Western swing pioneers. Spade Cooley and Tex Williams also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, Western swing rivaled the popularity of big band swing music.Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being \"too loud\" and \"not pure\", but by 1935 Western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the Texas Playboys. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry Louisiana Hayride kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956. By the early 1960s, however, it was rare for a country band not to have a drummer.[45] Bob Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[20] A decade later (1948) Arthur Smith achieved top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recording of \"Guitar Boogie\", which crossed over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar. For several decades Nashville session players preferred the warm tones of the Gibson and Gretsch archtop electrics, but a \"hot\" Fender style, using guitars which became available beginning in the early 1950s, eventually prevailed as the signature guitar sound of country.[45][46]Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was the Delmore Brothers' \"Freight Train Boogie\", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly. In 1948, Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of \"Guitar Boogie\" and \"Banjo Boogie\", with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.[47] Other country boogie artists included Moon Mullican, Merrill Moore and Tennessee Ernie Ford. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s and remains one of many subgenres of country into the 21st century.By the end of World War II, \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass had emerged when Bill Monroe joined with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. That was the ordination of bluegrass music and how Bill Monroe came to be known as the \"Father of Bluegrass.\" Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of bluegrass and other sorts of country music. Red Foley, the biggest country star following World War II, had one of the first million-selling gospel hits (\"Peace in the Valley\") and also sang boogie, blues and rockabilly. In the post-war period, country music was called \"folk\" in the trades, and \"hillbilly\" within the industry.[48] In 1944, Billboard replaced the term \"hillbilly\" with \"folk songs and blues,\" and switched to \"country\" or the mistaken term \"country and Western\" in 1949.[49][50]Another type of stripped down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among rural residents in the three states of Texhomex, those being Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.[51] It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly New Mexico and Texas,[52] together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as \"a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white\u00a0... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey.\"[53] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with \"Honky Tonk Blues\", and seven years later \"Pistol Packin' Mama\".[54] These \"honky tonk\" songs were associated with barrooms, and was performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams; the music of these artists would later be called \"traditional\" country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll,[55] such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.By the early 1950s, a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands, a mixture which followed in the footsteps of Gene Autry, Lydia Mendoza, Roy Rogers, and Patsy Montana. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, New Mexico, Texas country and Tejano music rhythms of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"El Paso\", first recorded by Marty Robbins in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, Western musicians like Michael Martin Murphey, New Mexico music artists Al Hurricane and Antonia Apodaca, Tejano music performer Little Joe, and even folk revivalist John Denver, all first rose to prominence during this time. This Western music influence largely kept the music of the folk revival and folk rock from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, the Byrds' negative reception during their appearance on the Grand Ole Opry). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. John Denver was perhaps the only musician to have major success in both the country and folk revival genres throughout his career, later only a handful of artists like Burl Ives and Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot successfully made the crossover to country after folk revival fell out of fashion. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.[56]In 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in Lubbock, Texas.[57] The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and truckers in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song Six Days on the Road by Dave Dudley began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like \"ICC\" for Interstate Commerce Commission and \"little white pills\" as a reference to amphetamines. Starday Records in Nashville followed up on Dudley's initial success with the release of Give me 40 Acres by the Willis Brothers.[57]Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s; one of the first rock and roll superstars was former Western yodeler Bill Haley, who repurposed his Four Aces of Western Swing into a rockabilly band in the early 1950s and renamed it the Comets. Bill Haley & His Comets are credited with two of the first successful rock and roll records, \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" of 1953 and \"Rock Around the Clock\" in 1954.[58]1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of rock and roll, an upbeat combination of blues and country music.[59] The number two, three and four songs on Billboard's charts for that year were Elvis Presley, \"Heartbreak Hotel\"; Johnny Cash, \"I Walk the Line\"; and Carl Perkins, \"Blue Suede Shoes\". Reflecting this success, George Jones released a rockabilly record that year under the pseudonym \"Thumper Jones\", wanting to capitilize on the popularity of rockabilly without alienating his traditional country base.[60] Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 \"Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger\" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley \"Don't/I Beg of You.\"[61] Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying \"The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.\" Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style.Country music gained national television exposure through Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from Springfield, Missouri. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the Ozarks. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, \"Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.\"[62] The late 1950s saw the emergence of Buddy Holly, but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional artists such as Ray Price, Marty Robbins, and Johnny Horton began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.The Country Music Association was founded in 1958, in part because numerous country musicians were appalled by the increased influence of rock and roll on country music.[63]Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee. Under the direction of producers such as Chet Atkins, Bill Porter, Paul Cohen, Owen Bradley, Bob Ferguson, and later Billy Sherrill, the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a string section (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, the Browns,[64] Patsy Cline, and Eddy Arnold. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician Floyd Cramer was an important component of this style.[65] The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the British Invasion and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into countrypolitan. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included Tammy Wynette, Lynn Anderson and Charlie Rich, as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as Ray Price and Marty Robbins. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Porter Wagoner, George Jones, and Sonny James among them.In 1962, Ray Charles surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western music, topping the charts and rating number three for the year on Billboard's pop chart[66] with the \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" single, and recording the landmark album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.[67]Another subgenre of country music grew out of hardcore honky tonk with elements of Western swing and originated 112 miles (180\u00a0km) north-northwest of Los Angeles in Bakersfield, California, where many \"Okies\" and other Dust Bowl migrants had settled. Influenced by one-time West Coast residents Bob Wills and Lefty Frizzell, by 1966 it was known as the Bakersfield sound. It relied on electric instruments and amplification, in particular the Telecaster electric guitar, more than other subgenres of the country music of the era, and it can be described as having a sharp, hard, driving, no-frills, edgy flavor\u2014hard guitars and honky-tonk harmonies.[57] Leading practitioners of this style were Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Tommy Collins, Dwight Yoakam, Gary Allan, and Wynn Stewart, each of whom had his own style.[68][69]Ken Nelson, who had produced Owens and Haggard and Rose Maddox became interested in the trucking song subgenre following the success of Six Days on the Road and asked Red Simpson to record an album of trucking songs. Haggard's White Line Fever was also part of the trucking subgenre.[57]The country music scene of the 1940s until the 1970s was largely dominated by Western music influences, so much so that the genre began to be called \"Country and Western\".[70] Even today, cowboy and frontier values continue to play a role in the larger country music, with Western wear, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats continues to be in fashion for country artists.[71]West of the Mississippi river, many of these Western genres continue to flourish, including the Red Dirt of Oklahoma,[72] New Mexico music of New Mexico,[73] and both Texas country music and Tejano music of Texas.[74][75] During the 1950s until the early 1970s, the latter part of the Western heyday in country music, many of these genres featured popular artists that continue to influence both their distinctive genres and larger country music. Red Dirt featured Bob Childers and Steve Ripley; for New Mexico music Al Hurricane, Al Hurricane Jr., and Antonia Apodaca; and within the Texas scenes Willie Nelson, Freddie Fender, Johnny Rodriguez, and Little Joe.As Outlaw country music emerged as subgenre in its own right, Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, and Tejano grew in popularity as a part of the Outlaw country movement. Originating in the bars, fiestas, and honky-tonks of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, their music supplemented outlaw country's singer-songwriter tradition as well as 21st-century rock-inspired alternative country and hip hop-inspired country rap artists.[76][77]Example of cowboy hat and cowboy boots, two prominent components of country music fashionWestern wear shirt design, with snap fastenersPainting of a cowboy singing by Thomas Eakins (1890)Freddy Fender performing Tejano music after The Johnny Cash Show in Nashville, Tennessee (1977)Bob Childers performing Red dirt in Okemah, Oklahoma (2001)Al Hurricane and Al Hurricane Jr. performing New Mexico music at a fiesta in Old Town Albuquerque (2014)Outlaw country was derived from the traditional Western, including Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, Tejano, and honky-tonk musical styles of the late 1950s and 1960s. Songs such as the 1963 Johnny Cash popularized \"Ring of Fire\" show clear influences from the likes of Al Hurricane and Little Joe, this influence just happened to culminate with artists such as Ray Price (whose band, the \"Cherokee Cowboys\", included Willie Nelson and Roger Miller) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, a collection of musicians that came to be known as the outlaw movement revolutionized the genre of country music in the early 1970s.[78][79] \"After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma. Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K. The whole outlaw thing, it had nothing to do with the music, it was something that got written in an article, and the young people said, 'Well, that's pretty cool.' And started listening.\" (Willie Nelson)[80] The term outlaw country is traditionally associated with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker,[81] Hank Williams, Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Joe Ely.[82] It was encapsulated in the 1976 album Wanted! The Outlaws.Though the outlaw movement as a cultural fad had died down after the late 1970s (with Jennings noting in 1978 that it had gotten out of hand and led to real-life legal scrutiny), many Western and Outlaw country music artists maintained their popularity during the 1980s by forming supergroups, such as The Highwaymen,[83] Texas Tornados,[84] and Bandido.[85]Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the countrypolitan sound, folk music, and soft rock, is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to adult contemporary music. It started with pop music singers like Glen Campbell, Bobbie Gentry, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, Anne Murray, B. J. Thomas, the Bellamy Brothers, and Linda Ronstadt having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"Rocky Mountain High\", \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", \"Annie's Song\", \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\", and \"I'm Sorry\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jean Shepard and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.During the mid-1970s, Dolly Parton, a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"Here You Come Again\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, Kenny Rogers, came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with the First Edition, achieving success the same year with \"Lucille\", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Country music propelled Kenny Rogers\u2019 career, making him a three-time Grammy Award winner and six-time Country Music Association Awards winner. Having sold more than 50 million albums in the US, one of his Song \"The Gambler,\" inspired multiple TV movies, with Rogers as the main character.[86] Artists like Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap and Barbara Mandrell would also find success on the pop charts with their records. In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the Saturday Evening Post, \"Country music isn't really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.\"[87]During the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. Willie Nelson and Juice Newton each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted \"Always on My Mind\" (No. 5, 1982) and \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\" (No. 5, 1984, a duet with Julio Iglesias), and Newton achieved success with \"Queen of Hearts\" (No. 2, 1981) and \"Angel of the Morning\" (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the Billboard Hot 100 in the 1980s: \"Lady\" by Kenny Rogers, from the late fall of 1980; \"9 to 5\" by Dolly Parton, \"I Love a Rainy Night\" by Eddie Rabbitt (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and \"Islands in the Stream\", a duet by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees. Newton's \"Queen of Hearts\" almost reached No. 1, but was kept out of the spot by the pop ballad juggernaut \"Endless Love\" by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie.[88] The move of country music toward neotraditional styles led to a marked decline in country/pop crossovers in the late 1980s, and only one song in that period\u2014Roy Orbison's \"You Got It\", from 1989\u2014made the top 10 of both the Billboard Hot Country Singles\" and Hot 100 charts, due largely to a revival of interest in Orbison after his sudden death.[89][90] The only song with substantial country airplay to reach number one on the pop charts in the late 1980s was \"At This Moment\" by Billy Vera and the Beaters, an R&B song with slide guitar embellishment that appeared at number 42 on the country charts from minor crossover airplay.[91] The record-setting, multi-platinum group Alabama was named Artist of the Decade for the 1980s by the Academy of Country Music.Country rock is a genre that started in the 1960s but became prominent in the 1970s. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included Bob Dylan, who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album John Wesley Harding[92] (and even more so with that album's follow-up, Nashville Skyline), followed by Gene Clark, Clark's former band the Byrds (with Gram Parsons on Sweetheart of the Rodeo) and its spin-off the Flying Burrito Brothers (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist Clarence White, Michael Nesmith (the Monkees and the First National Band), the Grateful Dead, Neil Young, Commander Cody, the Allman Brothers, the Marshall Tucker Band, Poco, Buffalo Springfield, Stephen Stills' band Manassas and Eagles, among many, even the former folk music duo Ian & Sylvia, who formed Great Speckled Bird in 1969. The Eagles would become the most successful of these country rock acts, and their compilation album Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975) remains the second-best-selling album in the US with 29\u00a0million copies sold.[93] The Rolling Stones also got into the act with songs like \"Dead Flowers\" and a country version of \"Honky Tonk Women\".Described by AllMusic as the \"father of country-rock\",[94] Gram Parsons' work in the early 1970s was acclaimed for its purity and for his appreciation for aspects of traditional country music.[95] Though his career was cut tragically short by his 1973 death, his legacy was carried on by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and duet partner Emmylou Harris; Harris would release her debut solo in 1975, an amalgamation of country, rock and roll, folk, blues and pop. Subsequent to the initial blending of the two polar opposite genres, other offspring soon resulted, including Southern rock, heartland rock and in more recent years, alternative country. In the decades that followed, artists such as Juice Newton, Alabama, Hank Williams, Jr. (and, to an even greater extent, Hank Williams III), Gary Allan, Shania Twain, Brooks & Dunn, Faith Hill, Garth Brooks, Dwight Yoakam, Steve Earle, Dolly Parton, Rosanne Cash and Linda Ronstadt moved country further towards rock influence.In 1980, a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized by the film Urban Cowboy,[96] which also included more traditional songs such as \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" by the Charlie Daniels Band.[97] It was during this time that a glut of pop-country crossover artists began appearing on the country charts: former pop stars Bill Medley (of the Righteous Brothers), \"England Dan\" Seals (of England Dan and John Ford Coley), Tom Jones, and Merrill Osmond (both alone and with some of his brothers; his younger sister Marie Osmond was already an established country star) all recorded significant country hits in the early 1980s. Sales in record stores rocketed to $250\u00a0million in 1981; by 1984, 900 radio stations began programming country or neocountry pop full-time. As with most sudden trends, however, by 1984 sales had dropped below 1979 figures.[96]Truck driving country music is a genre of country music[98]\nand is a fusion of honky-tonk, country rock and the Bakersfield sound.[99]\nIt has the tempo of country rock and the emotion of honky-tonk,[99] and its lyrics focus on a truck driver's lifestyle.[100] Truck driving country songs often deal with the profession of trucking and love.[99] Well-known artists who sing truck driving country include Dave Dudley, Red Sovine, Dick Curless, Red Simpson, Del Reeves, the Willis Brothers and Jerry Reed, with C. W. McCall and Cledus Maggard (pseudonyms of Bill Fries and Jay Huguely, respectively) being more humorous entries in the subgenre.[99] Dudley is known as the father of truck driving country.[100][101]During the mid-1980s, a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts, in favor of more, traditional, \"back-to-basics\" production. Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included Travis Tritt, Reba McEntire, George Strait, Keith Whitley, Alan Jackson, John Anderson, Patty Loveless, Kathy Mattea, Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam, Clint Black, Ricky Skaggs, and the Judds.Beginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. New marketing strategies were used to engage fans, powered by technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and boosted by a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. Garth Brooks (\"Friends in Low Places\") in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and stadium rock. Other artists such as Brooks and Dunn (\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\") also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while Lorrie Morgan, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Kathy Mattea updated neotraditionalist styles.[103]Country music was aided by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Docket 80\u201390, which led to a significant expansion of FM radio in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural AM radio stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by talk radio (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the classic country format for the AM audience). At the same time, beautiful music stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, Billboard, which had published a country music chart since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on country radio determined a song's place on the chart.[104]In the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to Garth Brooks,[105][106][107] who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The RIAA has certified his recordings at a combined (128\u00d7 platinum), denoting roughly 113\u00a0million U.S. shipments.[108] Other artists who experienced success during this time included Clint Black, John Michael Montgomery, Tracy Lawrence, Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson and the newly formed duo of Brooks & Dunn; George Strait, whose career began in the 1980s, also continued to have widespread success in this decade and beyond. Toby Keith began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the early 2000s with Pull My Chain and its follow-up, Unleashed.Female artists such as Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, LeAnn Rimes, Mindy McCready, Pam Tillis, Lorrie Morgan, Shania Twain, and Mary Chapin Carpenter all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The Dixie Chicks became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album Wide Open Spaces went on to become certified 12\u00d7 platinum while their 1999 album Fly went on to become 10\u00d7 platinum. After their third album, Home, was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer Natalie Maines's comments disparaging then-President George W. Bush while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the Iraq War a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's Taking the Long Way, took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall among non-country audiences but largely ignored among country audiences. After Taking the Long Way, the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the Court Yard Hounds) before reuniting in 2016 and releasing new material in 2020.Shania Twain became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, The Woman in Me, which was certified 12\u00d7 platinum sold over 20\u00a0million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's Come On Over, which was certified 20\u00d7 platinum and sold over 40\u00a0million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time.Unlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled Up!, which was certified 11\u00d7 platinum and sold over 15\u00a0million copies worldwide. Shania Twain has been nominated eighteen times for Grammy Awards and won five Grammys. [[109]] She was the best-paid country music star in 2016 according to Forbes, with a net worth of $27.5 million. [[110]]Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical 'honky-tonk' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.In the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of line dancing. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins was quoted as saying, \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"[111] By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as Don Williams and George Jones who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.With the fusion genre of \"country trap\"\u2014a fusion of country/western themes to a hip hop beat, but usually with fully sung lyrics\u2014emerging in the late 2010s, line dancing country had a minor revival. Examples of the phenomenon include \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and \"The Git Up\" by Blanco Brown, both of which topped the Billboard country charts despite scant radio airplay.Country influences combined with Punk rock and alternative rock to forge the \"cowpunk\" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as the Long Ryders, Lone Justice and the Beat Farmers, as well as the established punk group X, whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.[112] Simultaneously, a generation of diverse country artists outside of California emerged that rejected the perceived cultural and musical conservatism associated with Nashville's mainstream country musicians in favor of more countercultural outlaw country and the folk singer-songwriter traditions of artists such as Woody Guthrie, Gram Parsons and Bob Dylan.Artists from outside California who were associated with early alternative country included singer-songwriters such as Lucinda Williams, Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle, the Nashville country rock band Jason and the Scorchers, the Providence \"cowboy pop\" band Rubber Rodeo, and the British post-punk band the Mekons. Earle, in particular, was noted for his popularity with both country and college rock audiences: He promoted his 1986 debut album Guitar Town with a tour that saw him open for both country singer Dwight Yoakam and alternative rock band the Replacements.[113] Yoakam also cultivated a fanbase spanning multiple genres through his stripped-down honky-tonk influenced sound, association with the cowpunk scene, and performances at Los Angeles punk rock clubs.[114]These early styles had coalesced into a genre by the time the Illinois group Uncle Tupelo released their influential debut album No Depression in 1990.[115][116] The album is widely credited as being the first \"alternative country\" album, and inspired the name of No Depression magazine, which exclusively covered the new genre.[115][116] Following Uncle Tupelo's disbanding in 1994, its members formed two significant bands in genre: Wilco and Son Volt. Although Wilco's sound had moved away from country and towards indie rock by the time they released their critically acclaimed album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in 2002, they have continued to be an influence on later alt-country artists.Other acts who became prominent in the alt-country genre during the 1990s and 2000s included the Bottle Rockets, the Handsome Family, Blue Mountain, Robbie Fulks, Blood Oranges, Bright Eyes, Drive-By Truckers, Old 97's, Old Crow Medicine Show, Nickel Creek, Neko Case, and Whiskeytown, whose lead singer Ryan Adams later had a successful solo-career.[117] Alt-country, in various iterations overlapped with other genres, including Red Dirt country music (Cross Canadian Ragweed), jam bands (My Morning Jacket and the String Cheese Incident), and indie folk (the Avett Brothers).Despite the genre's growing popularity in the 1980s, '90s and 2000s, alternative country and neo-traditionalist artists saw minimal support from country radio in those decades, despite strong sales and critical acclaim for albums such as the soundtrack to the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?.[118] In 1987, the Beat Farmers gained airplay on country music stations with their song \"Make It Last\", but the single was pulled from the format when station programmers decreed the band's music was too rock-oriented for their audience.[119] However, some alt-country songs have been crossover hits to mainstream country radio in cover versions by established artists on the format; Lucinda Williams' \"Passionate Kisses\" was a hit for Mary Chapin Carpenter in 1993, Ryan Adams's \"When the Stars Go Blue\" was a hit for Tim McGraw in 2007, and Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Wagon Wheel\" was a hit for Darius Rucker in 2013.In the 2010s, the alt-country genre saw an increase in its critical and commercial popularity, owing to the success of artists such as the Civil Wars, Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell, Lydia Loveless and Margo Price. In 2019, Kacey Musgraves \u2013 a country artist who had gained a following with indie rock fans and music critics despite minimal airplay on country radio \u2013 won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her album Golden Hour.[120]The sixth generation of country music continued to be influenced by other genres such as pop, rock, and R&B. Richard Marx crossed over with his Days in Avalon album, which features five country songs and several singers and musicians. Alison Krauss sang background vocals to Marx's single \"Straight from My Heart.\" Also, Bon Jovi had a hit single, \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland. Kid Rock's collaboration with Sheryl Crow, \"Picture,\" was a major crossover hit in 2001 and began Kid Rock's transition from hard rock to a country-rock hybrid that would later produce another major crossover hit, 2008's \"All Summer Long.\" (Crow, whose music had often incorporated country elements, would also officially cross over into country with her hit \"Easy\" from her debut country album Feels like Home). Darius Rucker, frontman for the 1990s pop-rock band Hootie & the Blowfish, began a country solo career in the late 2000s, one that to date has produced five albums and several hits on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Singer-songwriter Unknown Hinson became famous for his appearance in the Charlotte television show Wild, Wild, South, after which Hinson started his own band and toured in southern states. Other rock stars who featured a country song on their albums were Don Henley (who released Cass County in 2015, an album which featured collaborations with numerous country artists) and Poison.The back half of the 2010-2020 decade saw an increasing number of mainstream country acts collaborate with pop and R&B acts; many of these songs achieved commercial success by appealing to fans across multiple genres; examples include collaborations between Kane Brown and Marshmello[121] and Maren Morris and Zedd.[122] There has also been interest from pop singers in country music, including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani, Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber and Pink.[123] Supporting this movement is the new generation of contemporary pop-country, including Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, Sam Hunt, Chris Young,[124] who introduced new themes in their works, touching on fundamental rights, feminism, and controversies about racism and religion of the older generations.[125]In 2005, country singer Carrie Underwood rose to fame as the winner of the fourth season of American Idol and has since become one of the most prominent recording artists in the genre, with worldwide sales of more than 65\u00a0million records and seven Grammy Awards.[126] With her first single, \"Inside Your Heaven\", Underwood became the only solo country artist to have a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the 2000\u20132009 decade and also broke Billboard chart history as the first country music artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by Billboard as the number 1 Country Album of the 2000\u20132009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present), having 14 No. 1s and breaking her own Guinness Book record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. Time has listed Underwood as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\nIn 2016, Underwood topped the Country Airplay chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.Carrie Underwood was only one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s. In addition to Underwood, American Idol launched the careers of Kellie Pickler, Josh Gracin, Bucky Covington, Kristy Lee Cook, Danny Gokey, Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery (as well as that of occasional country singer Kelly Clarkson[127]) in the decade, and would continue to launch country careers in the 2010s. The series Nashville Star, while not nearly as successful as Idol, did manage to bring Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves and Chris Young to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as Buddy Jewell, Sean Patrick McGraw, and Canadian musician George Canyon. Can You Duet? produced the duos Steel Magnolia and Joey + Rory. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress Jennette McCurdy (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom iCarly) released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"Generation Love\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, Miley Cyrus (of Hannah Montana), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"The Climb\" and another with a duet with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, with \"Ready, Set, Don't Go.\" Jana Kramer, an actress in the teen drama One Tree Hill, released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013. Actresses Hayden Panettiere and Connie Britton began recording country songs as part of their roles in the TV series Nashville and Pretty Little Liars star Lucy Hale released her debut album Road Between in 2014.In 2010, the group Lady Antebellum won five Grammys, including the coveted Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Need You Now\".[128] A large number of duos and vocal groups emerged on the charts in the 2010s, many of which feature close harmony in the lead vocals. In addition to Lady A, groups such as Little Big Town, the Band Perry, Gloriana, Thompson Square, Eli Young Band, Zac Brown Band and British duo the Shires have emerged to occupy a large share of mainstream success alongside solo singers such as Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert.One of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"Tim McGraw,\" was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Swift released her self-titled debut studio album, which spent 275 weeks on Billboard 200, one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, Fearless, which made her the second longest number-one charted on Billboard 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind Adele's 21) within the past 5 years. At the 2010 Grammys, Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for Fearless, which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten Grammys already.Buoyed by her teen idol status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the Billboard charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart and Hot Country Songs chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album 1989 (2014), Reputation (2017), and Lover (2019) were released solely to pop audiences.[129][130][131] Swift returned to country music in her recent folk-inspired releases, Folklore (2020) and Evermore (2020), with songs like \"Betty\" and \"No Body, No Crime\".Roots of conservative country was Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA\". The September 11 attacks of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)\", wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song \"New York, New York\" pays tribute to New York City, and its popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing in front of the Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city. In contrast, more rock-oriented country singers took more direct aim at the attacks' perpetrators; Toby Keith's \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\" threatened to \"a boot in\" the posterior of the enemy, while Charlie Daniels's \"This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag\" promised to \"hunt\" the perpetrators \"down like a mad dog hound.\" These songs gained such recognition that it put country music back into popular culture.[132] Darryl Worley recorded \"Have You Forgotten\" also.The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like Eric Church, Jason Aldean, and Brantley Gilbert have had success; Aaron Lewis, former frontman for the rock group Staind, had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012, as did Dallas Smith, former frontman of the band Default.In the early 2010s, \"bro-country\", a genre noted primarily for its themes on drinking and partying, girls, and pickup trucks became particularly popular.[133][134] Notable artists associated with this genre are Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton, Jake Owen and Florida Georgia Line whose song \"Cruise\" became the best-selling country song of all time.[22][135] Research in the mid-2010s suggested that about 45 percent of country's best-selling songs could be considered bro-country, with the top two artists being Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line.[136] Albums by bro-country singers also sold very well\u2014in 2013, Luke Bryan's Crash My Party was the third best-selling of all albums in the US, with Florida Georgia Line's Here's to the Good Times at sixth, and Blake Shelton's Based on a True Story at ninth.[137]  It is also thought that the popularity of bro-country helped country music to surpass classic rock as the most popular genre in America in 2012.[137] The genre however is controversial as it has been criticized by other country musicians and commentators over its themes and depiction of women,[138][139][140] opening up a divide between the older generation of country singers and the younger bro country singers that was described as \"civil war\" by musicians, critics, and journalists.\"[141] In 2014, Maddie & Tae's \"Girl in a Country Song\", addressing many of the controversial bro-country themes, peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.The Lone Star state can proudly claim some of the most talented musicians in country music. These artists have created large Texas based fan communities that regularly attend live shows throughout the state and of course tune in to listen to their favorite songs on radio stations in Texas and beyond. Texas country music has developed a secondary music chart to that of the country music chart based in Nashville. The Texas Country Music Chart is composed of artists who were born, reside or have connections to Texas. Artists on this chart are huge stars within the realm of Texas and the reach of Texas country radio airplay. The work these artists have made is not only important for Texas music, but country music in general. Artists currently paving the way for the sub genre include Cody Johnson, Aaron Watson and many others who fail to receive recognition from the country music community in Nashville. Traditional artists within Texas country include Bruce Robison, The Randy Rogers Band, Roger Creager, Pat Green and numerous other influential artists. Texas country music is a massive sleeping giant in the music industry and with growing interest and talent from the region and radio airplay, the country music scene is expecting change via Texas based artists.Bluegrass Country is a genre that contain songs about going through hard times, country loving, and telling stories. Newer artists like Billy Strings, the Grascals, Molly Tuttle, Tyler Childers and the Infamous Stringdusters have been increasing the popularity of this genre, alongside some of the genres more established stars who still remain popular including Rhonda Vincent, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Ricky Skaggs and Del McCoury. The genre has developed in the Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati area. Other artists include Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,[142] Johnny Cash,[143] Osborne Brothers, and many others.In an effort to combat the over-reliance of mainstream country music on pop-infused artists, the sister genre of Americana began to gain popularity and increase in prominence, receiving eight Grammy categories of its own in 2009. Americana music incorporates elements of country music, bluegrass, folk, blues, gospel, rhythm and blues, roots rock and southern soul and is overseen by the Americana Music Association and the Americana Music Honors & Awards.[144] As a result of an increasingly pop-leaning mainstream, many more traditional-sounding artists such as Tyler Childers, Zach Bryan and Old Crow Medicine Show began to associate themselves more with Americana and the alternative country scene where their sound was more celebrated. Similarly, many established country acts who no longer received commercial airplay, including Emmylou Harris and Lyle Lovett, began to flourish again.[145]In the mid to late 2010s, country music began to increasingly sound more like the style of modern-day Pop music,[124] with more simple and repetitive lyrics, more electronic-based instrumentation, and experimentation with \"talk-singing\" and rap, pop-country pulled farther away from the traditional sounds of country music and received criticisms from country music purists while gaining in popularity with mainstream audiences.[147] The topics addressed have also changed, turning controversial such as acceptance of the LGBT community, safe sex, recreational marijuana use, and questioning religious sentiment.[125] Influences also come from some pop artists' interest in the country genre, including Justin Timberlake with the album Man of the Woods,[148] Beyonc\u00e9's single \"Daddy Lessons\" from Lemonade,[149] Gwen Stefani with \"Nobody but You\",[150] Bruno Mars,[151] Lady Gaga,[152] Alicia Keys,[153] Kelly Clarkson,[127] and Pink.[154]Some modern artists that primarily or entirely produce country pop music include Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris, Kelsea Ballerini, Sam Hunt, Kane Brown, Chris Lane, and Dan + Shay.[155] The singers who are part of this country movement are also defined as \"Nashville's new generation of country\".[156]Although the changes made by the new generation, it has been recognized by major music awards associations and successes in Billboard and international charts. Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves won album of the year at 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards, Country Music Association Awards,[157] although it has received widespread criticism from the more traditionalist public.[158] Lil Nas X song \"Old Town Road\" spent 19 weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the longest-running number-one song since the chart debuted in 1958, winning Billboard Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and Grammy Award.[159] Sam Hunt  \"Leave the Night On\" peaked concurrently on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, making Hunt the first country artist in 22 years, since Billy Ray Cyrus, to reach the top of three country charts simultaneously in the Nielsen SoundScan-era.[160] Maren Morris success collaboration \"The Middle\" with EDM producer Zedd is considered one of the representations of the fusion of electro-pop with country music.[161]Australian country music has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian bush balladeers like Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. Country instruments, including the guitar, banjo, fiddle and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.Folk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government tyranny, or the lives of bushrangers, swagmen, drovers, stockmen and shearers, continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"bush band music\". \"Waltzing Matilda\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem, is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include \"The Wild Colonial Boy\", \"Click Go the Shears\", \"The Queensland Drover\" and \"The Dying Stockman\". Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of Aboriginality and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.[162][163]Pioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included Tex Morton (known as \"The Father of Australian Country Music\") in the 1930s. Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included Buddy Williams, Shirley Thoms and Smoky Dawson. Buddy Williams (1918\u20131986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.In 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. Slim Dusty (1927\u20132003) was known as the \"King of Australian Country Music\" and helped to popularise the Australian bush ballad. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit \"A Pub with No Beer\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.[164] Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing \"Waltzing Matilda\" in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Dusty's wife Joy McKean penned several of his most popular songs.Chad Morgan, who began recording in the 1950s, has represented a vaudeville style of comic Australian country; Frank Ifield achieved considerable success in the early 1960s, especially in the UK Singles Charts and Reg Lindsay was one of the first Australians to perform at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry in 1974.[165] Eric Bogle's 1972 folk lament to the Gallipoli Campaign \"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\" recalled the British and Irish origins of Australian folk-country. Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, whose music style straddles folk, rock and country, is often described as the poet laureate of Australian music.[166]By the 1990s, country music had attained crossover success in the pop charts, with artists like James Blundell and James Reyne singing \"Way Out West\", and country star Kasey Chambers winning the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist in 2000, 2002 and 2004, tying with pop stars Wendy Matthews and Sia for the most wins in that category. Furthermore, Chambers has gone on to win nine ARIA Awards for Best Country Album and, in 2018, became the youngest artist to ever be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. The crossover influence of Australian country is also evident in the music of successful contemporary bands the Waifs and the John Butler Trio. Nick Cave has been heavily influenced by the country artist Johnny Cash. In 2000, Cash, covered Cave's \"The Mercy Seat\" on the album American III: Solitary Man, seemingly repaying Cave for the compliment he paid by covering Cash's \"The Singer\" (originally \"The Folk Singer\") on his Kicking Against the Pricks album. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" for Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around album (2002).[167]Popular contemporary performers of Australian country music include John Williamson (who wrote the iconic \"True Blue\"), Lee Kernaghan (whose hits include \"Boys from the Bush\" and \"The Outback Club\"), Gina Jeffreys, Forever Road and Sara Storer. In the United States, Olivia Newton-John, Sherri\u00e9 Austin and Keith Urban have attained great success. During her time as a country singer in the 1970s, Newton-John became the first (and to date only) non-American winner of the Country Music Association Award for Female Vocalist of the Year which many considered a controversial decision by the CMA; after starring in the rock-and-roll musical film Grease in 1978, Newton-John (mirroring the character she played in the film) shifted to pop music in the 1980s. Urban is arguably considered the most successful international Australian country star, winning nine CMA Awards, including three Male Vocalist of the Year wins and two wins of the CMA's top honour Entertainer of the Year. Pop star Kylie Minogue found success with her 2018 country pop album Golden which she recorded in Nashville reaching number one in Scotland, the UK and her native Australia.Country music has been a particularly popular form of musical expression among Indigenous Australians. Troy Cassar-Daley is among Australia's successful contemporary indigenous performers, and Kev Carmody and Archie Roach employ a combination of folk-rock and country music to sing about Aboriginal rights issues.[168]The Tamworth Country Music Festival began in 1973 and now attracts up to 100,000 visitors annually. Held in Tamworth, New South Wales (country music capital of Australia), it celebrates the culture and heritage of Australian country music. During the festival the CMAA holds the Country Music Awards of Australia ceremony awarding the Golden Guitar trophies.  Other significant country music festivals include the Whittlesea Country Music Festival (near Melbourne) and the Mildura Country Music Festival for \"independent\" performers during October, and the Canberra Country Music Festival held in the national capital during November.Country HQ showcases new talent on the rise in the country music scene down under. CMC (the Country Music Channel), a 24\u2011hour music channel dedicated to non-stop country music, can be viewed on pay TV and features once a year the Golden Guitar Awards, CMAs and CCMAs alongside international shows such as The Wilkinsons, The Road Hammers, and Country Music Across America.Outside of the United States, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base, something that is to be expected given the two countries' proximity and cultural parallels. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the prairie provinces, the British Columbia Interior, Ontario, and in Atlantic Canada.[169] Celtic traditional music developed in Atlantic Canada in the form of Scottish, Acadian and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish, French and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Atlantic Provinces (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island).[169] Like the southern United States and Appalachia, all four regions are of heavy British Isles stock and rural; as such, the development of traditional music in the Maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the US South and Appalachia. Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or \"sea shanty\" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and Irish in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.Don Messer's Jubilee was a Halifax, Nova Scotia-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed The Ed Sullivan Show broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. Don Messer's Jubilee followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named \"Goin' to the Barndance Tonight\", followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his \"Islanders\" including singers Marg Osburne and Charlie Chamberlain, the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with \"Till We Meet Again\". The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including Stompin' Tom Connors and Catherine McKinnon. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. Hank Snow, Wilf Carter (also known as Montana Slim), and Anne Murray are the three most notable. The cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.The Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.[169] While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of Scottish, Ukrainian, German and others. For these reasons polkas and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the folk or Celtic genres.[169]Canadian country pop star Shania Twain is the best-selling female country artist of all time and one of the best-selling artists of all time in any genre.[170][171] Furthermore, she is the only woman to have three consecutive albums be certified Diamond.Country music artists from the United States have seen crossover appeal with Latin American audiences, particularly in Mexico. Especially artists from the Southwestern United States in the genres of New Mexico music and Tejano \"Tex-Mex\" which are popular, throughout Latin America, beyond their New Mexico and Texas audiences. Many Country music artists from throughout the United States have recorded renditions of Mexican folk songs, including \"El Rey\" which was performed on George Strait's Twang album and during Al Hurricane's tribute concert. Even American Latin pop crossover musicians, like Lorenzo Antonio's \"Ranchera Jam\" have combined Mexican staples \"Cielito Lindo\" and Tito Gu\u00edzar's \"All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande\" with country music classics Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\" and Hank Williams' \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\", in a New Mexico music style. During the 1970s, Tejano music singer-songwriter Freddy Fender had two #1 country music singles, that were popular throughout North America, with \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" and \"Wasted Days and Wasted Nights\". Songs inspired by Hispanic and Latin culture have long been performed by American country music artists, including Marty Robbins' \"El Paso\" trilogy, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covering the Townes Van Zandt song \"Pancho and Lefty\", \"Toes\" by Zac Brown Band, and \"Sangria\" by Blake Shelton.Regional Mexican is a radio format featuring many of Mexico's versions of country music. It includes a number of different styles, usually named after their region of origin. One specific song style, the Canci\u00f3n Ranchera, or simply Ranchera, literally meaning \"ranch song\", found its origins in the Mexican countryside and was first popularized with Mariachi. It has since also become popular with Grupero, Banda, Norte\u00f1o, Tierra Caliente, Duranguense and other regional Mexican styles. The Corrido, a different song style with a similar history, is also performed in many different regional styles, and is most related to the Western style of the United States and Canada. Country en Espa\u00f1ol (Country in Spanish) is also popular in Mexico. It became prominent in the northern regions of the country during the 1980s, and it most resembles Neotraditional country. Other song styles performed in regional Mexican music include Ballads, Cumbias, Boleros, among others.In Brazil, there is M\u00fasica Sertaneja, the most popular music genre in that country. It originated in the countryside of S\u00e3o Paulo state in the 1910s, before the development of American country music.In Argentina, on the last weekend of September, the yearly San Pedro Country Music Festival[172][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] takes place in the town of San Pedro, Buenos Aires. The festival features bands from different places in Argentina, as well as international artists from Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru and the United States.Country music is popular in the United Kingdom, although somewhat less so than in other English-speaking countries. There are some British country music acts and publications. Although radio stations devoted to country are among the most popular in other Anglophone nations, none of the top 10 most-listened-to stations in the UK are country stations, and national broadcaster BBC Radio does not offer a full-time country station (BBC Radio 2 Country, a \"pop-up\" station, operated four days each year between 2015 and 2017). The BBC does offer a country show on BBC Radio 2 each week hosted by Bob Harris.[173]The most successful British country music act of the 21st century are Ward Thomas and the Shires. In 2015, the Shires' album Brave, became the first UK country act ever to chart in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart and they became the first UK country act to receive an award from the American Country Music Association.[174] In 2016, Ward Thomas then became the first UK country act to hit number 1 in the UK Albums Chart with their album Cartwheels.There is the C2C: Country to Country festival held every year, and for many years there was a festival at Wembley Arena, which was broadcast on the BBC, the International Festivals of Country Music, promoted by Mervyn Conn, held at the venue between 1969 and 1991. The shows were later taken into Europe, and featured such stars as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, David Allan Coe, Emmylou Harris, Boxcar Willie, Johnny Russell and Jerry Lee Lewis. A handful of country musicians had even greater success in mainstream UK music than they did in the US, despite a certain amount of disdain from the music press. The UK's largest music festival Glastonbury has featured major US country acts in recent years, such as Kenny Rogers in 2013 and Dolly Parton in 2014.From within the UK, few country musicians achieved widespread mainstream success. Many British singers who performed the occasional country songs are of other genres. Tom Jones, by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (\"Rest Your Love on Me\") and a major hit as songwriters (\"Islands in the Stream\"); Barry Gibb, the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style.[175] Singer Engelbert Humperdinck, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with \"After the Lovin',\" achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his covers of Nashville country ballads such as \"Release Me,\" \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" and \"There Goes My Everything.\" The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler initially started her career making country records, and in 1978 her single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album Rocks and Honey which featured a duet with Vince Gill.A niche country subgenre popular in the West Country is Scrumpy and Western, which consists mostly of novelty songs and comedy music recorded there (its name comes from scrumpy, an alcoholic beverage). A primarily local interest, the largest Scrumpy and Western hit in the UK and Ireland was \"The Combine Harvester,\" which pioneered the genre and reached number one in both the UK and Ireland; Fred Wedlock had a number-six hit in 1981 with \"The Oldest Swinger in Town.\"In Ireland, Country and Irish is a music genre that combines traditional Irish folk music with American country music. Television channel TG4 began a quest for Ireland's next country star called Gl\u00f3r T\u00edre, translated as \"Country Voice\". It is now in its sixth season and is one of TG4's most-watched TV shows. Over the past ten years, country and gospel recording artist James Kilbane has reached multi-platinum success with his mix of Christian and traditional country influenced albums. James Kilbane like many other Irish artists is today working closer with Nashville. Daniel O'Donnell achieved international success with his brand of music crossing country, Irish folk and European easy listening, earning a strong following among older women[176] both in the British Isles and in North America. A recent success in the Irish arena has been Crystal Swing.Tom Roland, from the Country Music Association International, explains country music's global popularity: \"In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners around the globe have something in common with those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits.\"[177] One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was George Hamilton IV. He was the first country musician to perform in the Soviet Union; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the \"International Ambassador of Country Music\" for his contributions to the globalization of country music.[178] Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours.[177] The Country Music Association undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.[177]In India, the Anglo-Indian community is well known for enjoying and performing country music. An annual concert festival called \"Blazing Guitars\"[179] held in Chennai brings together Anglo-Indian musicians from all over the country (including some who have emigrated to places like Australia).\nThe year 2003 brought home \u2013 grown Indian, Bobby Cash to the forefront of the country music culture in India when he became India's first international country music artist to chart singles in Australia.In Iran, country music has appeared in recent years. According to Melody Music Magazine, the pioneer of country music in Iran is the English-speaking country music band Dream Rovers, whose founder, singer and songwriter is Erfan Rezayatbakhsh (elf).[180] The band was formed in 2007 in Tehran,[181] and during this time they have been trying to introduce and popularize country music in Iran by releasing two studio albums[182] and performing live at concerts, despite the difficulties that the Islamic regime in Iran makes for bands that are active in the western music field.[183]In Japan, electronic music producer and DJ Yasutaka Nakata started to create a country-folk style of music for model and entertainer Mito Natsume. Mito's activities as a singer has yielded to her debut studio album, Natsumelo, in 2017.In the Philippines, country music has found their way into Cordilleran way of life, which often compares the Igorot lifestyle to that of American cowboys. Baguio City has an FM station that caters to country music, DZWR 99.9 Country, which is part of the Catholic Media Network. Bombo Radyo Baguio has a segment on its Sunday slot for Igorot, Ilocano and country music. And as of recently, DWUB occasionally plays country music.In Sweden, Rednex rose to stardom combining country music with electro-pop in the 1990s. In 1994, the group had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\". Artists popularizing more traditional country music in Sweden have been Ann-Louise Hanson, Hasse Andersson, Kikki Danielsson, Elisabeth Andreassen and Jill Johnson. In Poland an international country music festival, known as Piknik Country, has been organized in Mr\u0105gowo in Masuria since 1983. There are more and more country music artists in France. Some of the most important are Liane Edwards, Annabel\u00a0[fr], Rockie Mountains, Tahiana, and Lili West. French rock and roll superstar Eddy Mitchell is also very inspired by Americana and country music. In the Netherlands there are many artists producing popular country and Americana music, which is mostly in the English language, as well as Dutch country and country-like music in the Dutch language. The latter is mainly popular on the countrysides in the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands and is less associated with his American brother, although it sounds sometimes very similar. Well known popular artists mainly performing in English are Waylon, Danny Vera, Ilse DeLange, Douwe Bob and the band Savannah. The most popular artist in Dutch is Henk Wijngaard.Several U.S. TV networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: Country Music Television (the first channel devoted to country music) and CMT Music (both owned by Paramount Global), RFD-TV and The Cowboy Channel (both owned by Rural Media Group), Heartland (owned by Get After It Media), Circle (a joint venture of the Grand Ole Opry and Gray Television), and The Country Network (owned by TCN Country, LLC).The Nashville Network (TNN) was launched in 1983 as a channel devoted to country music, and later added sports and outdoor lifestyle programming. It actually launched just two days after CMT.  In 2000, after TNN and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, TNN was stripped of its country format and rebranded as The National Network, then Spike, and finally Paramount Network. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts Crook & Chase) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.Great American Country (GAC) was launched in 1995, also as a country music-oriented channel that would later add lifestyle programming pertaining to the American Heartland and South. In the spring of 2021, GAC's then-owner, Discovery, Inc. divested the network to GAC Media, which also acquired the equestrian network Ride TV. Later, in the summer of that year, GAC Media relaunched Great American Country as GAC Family, a family-oriented general entertainment network, while Ride TV was relaunched as GAC Living, a network devoted to programming pertaining to lifestyles of the American South. The GAC acronym which once stood for \"Great American Country\" now stands for \"Great American Channels\".Only one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: CMT owned by Corus Entertainment (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, Cancom-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day Cottage Life network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. Stingray Music continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on cable radio.In the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, CBC Television. The show Don Messer's Jubilee significantly affected country music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched Anne Murray's career. Gordie Tapp's Country Hoedown and its successor, The Tommy Hunter Show, ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.The only network dedicated to country music in Australia was the Country Music Channel owned by Foxtel. It ceased operations in June 2020 and was replaced by CMT (owned by Network 10 parent company Paramount Networks UK & Australia).[citation needed]One music channel is currently dedicated to country music in the United Kingdom: Spotlight TV, owned by Canis Media.Computer science and music experts identified issues with algorithms on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, specifically the categorical homogenization of music curation and metadata within larger genres such as country music. Musicians and songs from minority heritage styles, such as Appalachian, Cajun, New Mexico, and Tejano music, underperform on these platforms due to underrepresentation and miscategorization of these subgenres.[184][185][77][186][187]The Country Music Association has awarded the New Artist award to a Black American only twice in 63 years, and never to a Hispanic musician. The broader modern Nashville-based Country music industry has underrepresented significant Black and Latino contributions within Country music, including popular subgenres such as Cajun, Creole, Tejano, and New Mexico music.[188][189][190] A 2021 CNN article states, \"Some in country music have signaled that they are no longer content to be associated with a painful history of racism.\u2009\"[189][191][192]In February 2021, TMZ released a video of Morgan Wallen that was recorded outside his Nashville home in which he used a racial slur. The incident resulted in Morgan Wallen's suspension from his record label and the removal of his music from major radio networks in the United States.[193] The Country Music Association awarded Wallen its New Artist of the Year award in 2020, but even in the wake of Wallen's use of the slur the organization has declined to revoke the award, perhaps because Wallen's music experienced a surge in commercial success following the incident.[194][195] Black country-music artist Mickey Guyton has been included among the nominees for the 2021 award, effectively creating a litmus-test for the genre. Guyton has expressed bewilderment that, despite substantial coverage by online platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, her music, like that of Valerie June,[196][circular reference] another Black musician who embraces aspects of country in her Appalachian- and Gospel-tinged work and who has been embraced by international music audiences, is still effectively ignored by American broadcast country-music radio.[197] Guyton's 2021 album Remember Her Name  in part references the case of Black health-care professional Breonna Taylor,[198][circular reference] who was killed in her home by police.[199]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Taylor_Swift": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting\u2014often inspired by her personal life\u2014has received critical praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, before releasing her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.Swift explored country pop on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of the singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. She experimented with rock and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". Swift eschewed country for her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". The media scrutiny on Swift's life influenced her urban album Reputation (2017), which, led by the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\", made Swift the only act in MRC Data history with four albums that sold over a million copies in a week.Parting ways with Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019). Inspired by escapism during the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift ventured into indie folk and alternative rock styles on her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore, receiving plaudits for their nuanced storytelling. Following a dispute over the masters of her back catalog, she released the 2021 re-recordings Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) to universal acclaim. Number-one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\" and \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" made Swift the only act to simultaneously debut atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts thrice. Besides music, she has played supporting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010) and Cats (2019), released the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), and directed the musical films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Eight of her songs have topped the Hot 100, and her concert tours are some of the highest-grossing in history. She has received 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 34 American Music Awards (the most for an artist), 25 Billboard Music Awards (the most for a woman) and 56 Guinness World Records, among other accolades. She featured on  Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015), Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (2019), the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100 rankings. Named Woman of the 2010s Decade by Billboard and Artist of the 2010s Decade by the American Music Awards, Swift has been regarded as a pop icon due to her influential career, philanthropy, and advocacy of artists' rights and women's empowerment in the music industry.Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at the Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch;[3] her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] She was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor,[6] and has Scottish[7] and German heritage. Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[8] Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father purchased from one of his clients.[11][12] Swift identifies as a Christian.[13] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[14] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[15] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[16] where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[17]At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[18] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[19] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything.\"[20] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[21][22] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[23] She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke covers.[24] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[25]When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[26] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[27] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[28][29][30]To help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[11][31] Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School[32] before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which could better accommodate her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[33]In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[34][35] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[36] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[37] Rose thought the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[38] but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\u2019s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists,[30][22] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[39]At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[40] Becoming one of the first signings at Big Machine, she wanted \"the kind of attention that a little [new] label will give,\"[30] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after. Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[22] She wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[44] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice.\"[45] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, where it spent 157 weeks\u2014the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.[46]Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\"; Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio.\"[48] As there were not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[48] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour[49] after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time.[50] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[48][11] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\", and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[51] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[52] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[53][54] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours throughout 2006 and 2007, including George Strait,[55] Brad Paisley,[56] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[57]Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[58] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[59] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[60] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[61] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[62] She opened for the Rascal Flatts on their 2008 summer and fall tour.[63] In July of that year, Swift began a romance with singer Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[64][65]Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.[68] Five singles were released in 2008 through 2009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". \"Love Story\", the lead single, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[52][69] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[70] All five singles were Billboard Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" peaking at number one.[71] Fearless debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top-selling album of 2009 in the U.S.[72] The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63\u00a0million.[73] Journey to Fearless, a three-part documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[74] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[75]In 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.[76] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[77] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention, and many Internet memes.[78] James Montgomery of MTV argued that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\".[79] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[80] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[81] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[82] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[83] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[86]Swift featured on John Mayer's single \"Half of My Heart\" and Boys Like Girls' single \"Two Is Better Than One\", both of which she co-wrote.[87][88] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[89] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\u2014\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[67] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[90][91] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner; they broke up later that year.[92] Swift's role of the ditzy girlfriend of Lautner's character received mixed reviews.[93][94] In 2009, she made her television acting debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode.[95] She also hosted and performed as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live; she was the first host to write her own opening monologue.[96][97]In August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number three.[98] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[99] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[100] debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of one million copies.[101] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records.[102] The songs \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\" were released as singles.

Kennedy Jr. and Mary Richardson Kennedy.[120]In August 2012, Swift released \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red. It became her first number one in the U.S. and New Zealand,[121][122] and reached the top slot on iTunes' digital song sales chart 50 minutes after its release, earning the Fastest Selling Single in Digital History Guinness World Record.[123] Other singles released from the album include \"Begin Again\", \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\". \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" reached the top five on charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S.[124] Three singles, \"Begin Again\", \"22\", and \"Red\", reached the top 20 in the U.S.[52]Red was released on October 22, 2012.[125] On Red, Swift worked with longtime collaborators Nathan Chapman and Liz Rose, as well as new producers, including Max Martin and Shellback.[126] The album incorporated new genres for Swift, such as heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop.[127] It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21\u00a0million copies, making Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings, a record recognized by the Guinness World Records.[128][129] Red was Swift's first number-one album in the U.K.[130] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150\u00a0million, becoming the highest-grossing country tour when it completed.[131]Red had sold eight million copies by 2014.[132] The album earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014.[133] Its single \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" won Best Female Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[134] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, and Artist of the Year in 2013.[135][136] She received the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years in 2012 and 2013.[137] Swift was honored by the Association with a special Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[138] During this time, she had a short-term relationship with English singer Harry Styles.[139]In 2013, Swift recorded \"Sweeter than Fiction\", a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack. The song received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[140] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw's song \"Highway Don't Care\", which featured guitar work by Keith Urban.[141] Swift performed \"As Tears Go By\" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois as part of the band's 50 & Counting tour.[142] She joined Florida Georgia Line on stage during their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing \"Cruise\".[143] Swift voiced Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[144] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[145] and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of The Giver (2014).[146]In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City.[note 2] Around this time, she worked on her fifth studio album, 1989, with producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[149] She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions.[150] Influenced by 1980s synth-pop, Swift severed ties with the country sound of her previous albums and marketed 1989 as her \"first documented, official pop album\".[151] The album was released on October 27, 2014, and debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 with sales of 1.28\u00a0million copies in its first week.

Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015, and broke museum attendance records.[167][168] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[169] The video for \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[170] Swift was one of eight artists to receive a 50th Anniversary Milestone Award at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards.[171] At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, and \"Bad Blood\" won Best Music Video. Swift was the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice as a lead artist.[172]Swift dated Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[173] Prior to their breakup, they co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", which features vocals from Barbadian singer Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sj\u00f6berg.[174] After briefly dating English actor Tom Hiddleston for a few months,[175] Swift began dating English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177] She wrote the song \"Better Man\" for Little Big Town's seventh album, The Breaker, which was released in November.[note 3] The song earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released a single together, \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number two in the U.S.[180] and won Best Collaboration at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[181]In August 2017, Swift successfully sued David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault for nominal damages of only one dollar.[182] The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[183] After a one-year hiatus from the public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts[184] and released \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[185] The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single.[186] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.[187]Reputation was released on November 10, 2017.[188] The album incorporated a heavy electropop sound, along with hip hop, R&B and EDM influences.[189] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21\u00a0million copies. With this achievement, Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the U.S.[190] The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[191] First-week worldwide sales amounted to two million copies.[192] The album had sold over 4.5\u00a0million copies worldwide as of 2018.[193] It spawned three other international singles, including the U.S. top-five entry \"...Ready for It?\",[194] and two U.S. top-20 singles\u2014\"End Game\" (featuring Ed Sheeran and rapper Future) and \"Delicate\".[157] Other singles include \"New Year's Day\", which was exclusively released to U.S. country radio,[195] and \"Getaway Car\", which was released in Australia only.[196]In April 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland's \"Babe\" from their album Bigger.[note 4] In support of Reputation, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour, which ran from May to November 2018.[198] In the U.S., the tour grossed $266.1\u00a0million in box office and sold over two million tickets, breaking Swift's own record for the highest-grossing U.S. tour by a woman, which was previously held by her 1989 World Tour in 2015 ($181.5\u00a0million).[199] It also broke the record for the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history. Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7\u00a0million,[200] making it the second highest-grossing concert tour of the year.[201] On December 31, Swift released her Reputation Stadium Tour's accompanying concert film on Netflix.[202]Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.[203] At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. After the 2018 AMAs, Swift garnered a total of 23 awards, becoming the most awarded female musician in AMA history, a record previously held by Whitney Houston.[204]Reputation was Swift's last album under her 12-year contract with Big Machine Records. In November 2018, she signed a new multi-album deal with Big Machine's distributor Universal Music Group; in the U.S., her subsequent releases were promoted under the Republic Records imprint. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her master recordings. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among their artists.[205] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was \"far from assured\" until Swift intervened.[206]Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019.[207] Besides longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff, Swift worked with new producers Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[208] Lover made Swift the first female artist to have a sixth consecutive album sell more than 500,000 copies in one week in the U.S.[209] All 18 songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week, setting a record for the most simultaneous entries by a woman.[210] The lead single, \"Me!\", debuted at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100 and rose to number two a week later, scoring the biggest single-week jump in chart history.[211] Other singles from Lover were the U.S. top-10 singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\", and U.S. top-40 single \"The Man\".[52]Lover was the world's best-selling studio album of 2019, selling 3.2\u00a0million copies.[212] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) honored Swift as the global best-selling artist of 2019. Swift became first woman to win the honor twice, having previously won in 2014.[213] The album earned accolades, including three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[214] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Me!\" won Best Visual Effects, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[215]Swift played Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019).[216] For the film's soundtrack, she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[217][218] Although critics reviewed the film negatively, Swift received positive feedback for her role and musical performance.[219] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicles part of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix that January.[220][221] Miss Americana featured the song \"Only the Young\", which Swift wrote after the 2018 United States elections.[222] In February 2020, Swift signed an exclusive global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing expired.[223]In 2019, Swift became embroiled in a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog.[224] Swift stated on her Tumblr blog that she had been trying to buy the masters for years; however, Big Machine only would allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under another contract, which she refused to do.[224][225] Against Swift's authorization, in April 2020, Big Machine released Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008, a live album of Swift's performances at a radio show.[226] In October, Braun sold Swift's masters, videos and artworks to Shamrock Holdings for a reported $300\u00a0million.[227] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[228] Rolling Stone highlighted this decision, along with her opposition to low royalties for artists from streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, as two of the music industry's most defining moments in the 2010s decade.[229] In April 2020, Swift was scheduled to embark on Lover Fest, the supporting concert tour for Lover, which was canceled after the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.[230]In 2020, Swift released two surprise albums to critical acclaim.[231] The first, her eighth studio album Folklore, was released on July 24.[232] The second, her ninth studio album Evermore, was released on December 11.[233] Described by Swift and Dessner as \"sister records\", both albums explore indie folk and alternative rock, departing from her previous upbeat pop releases.[234][235] Swift wrote and recorded the albums while in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, working with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner from the National. Both albums feature collaborations with Bon Iver, and Evermore features the National and Haim additionally.[236] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced select songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[237] The making of Folklore was discussed in the concert documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020), directed by Swift.[238]Folklore and Evermore were each supported by three singles in the U.S., catering to mainstream radio, country radio, and triple A radio; the singles, in that order, were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" (featuring Bon Iver) from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\" (featuring Haim), and \"Coney Island\" (featuring the National) from Evermore.[239] \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\", opened at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week their parent albums debuted atop the Billboard 200. This made Swift the first artist to debut atop both the U.S. singles and albums charts simultaneously, as well as the first to do so twice.[240] Each album sold over a million units in its first week globally, with Folklore selling two million[241][242] and breaking the Guinness World Record for the highest first-day album streams by a female artist on Spotify.[243] It was 2020's best-selling album in the U.S. with 1.2\u00a0million copies.[244] Swift was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.[245] At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[246] Folklore won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history to win the award thrice.[247]Following the masters dispute, Swift released two re-recorded albums in 2021, adding \"Taylor's Version\" to their titles. The first, Fearless (Taylor's Version), peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming the first re-recorded album to do so.[248] It was preceded by the three tracks: \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", \"You All Over Me\" with Maren Morris, and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\",[249] the first of which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and the re-recording of a single reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[250] The second re-recording Red (Taylor's Version) was released on November 12.[251] Its final track, \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\"\u2014accompanied by the namesake short film directed by Swift\u2014debuted at number one on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart.[252] She was the highest-paid female musician of 2021,[253] and both her 2020 albums and the re-recordings were ranked among the 10 best-selling albums of the year.[254] In May 2021, Swift was awarded the Global Icon Award by the Brit Awards[255] and the Songwriter Icon Award by the National Music Publishers' Association.[256]Swift further released \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" on September 17, 2021, and \"This Love (Taylor's Version)\" on May 6, 2022; they were featured in the trailers for animated film Spirit Untamed (2021) and Amazon Prime Video series The Summer I Turned Pretty (2022), respectively.[257][258] Outside her albums, she featured on four songs from 2021 to 2022: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[259] a remix of Haim's \"Gasoline\"[260] and Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\".[261] Swift wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", a song for the film adaptation of Delia Owens' 2018 novel, Where the Crawdads Sing.[262] She will appear in David O. Russell's period film Amsterdam, scheduled for release in November 2022.[263]One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[4] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[264] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[265] She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother.[266] Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[267] and was introduced to the genre listening to \"the great female country artists\" of the 1990s\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[268][269] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[270] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it.\"[271] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[272] \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[273] Swift also explored the music of older country stars such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[21] the latter of whom she believes is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\",[274] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[275] and Lori McKenna.[11] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell, citing especially how Mitchell's autobiographical lyrics convey the deepest emotions: \"She wrote it about her deepest pains and most haunting demons ... I think [Blue] is my favorite because it explores somebody's soul so deeply.\"[276]Swift has also been influenced by various pop and rock artists. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams,[277] Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models. Discussing McCartney and Harris, Swift has said, \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\".[11][278] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind\u00a0[...] He's out there continuing to make his fans so happy. Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.\"[279] She likes Springsteen for being \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\".[280] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older because she admired how Harris prioritized music over fame.[281] Swift says that Kristofferson \"shines in songwriting\",[282] and she praised Simon for being \"emotional\" but \"strong\" at the same time.[283] Her synth-pop album 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[284][285] She has also cited Keith Urban's musical style[286] and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.[287]\"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur.\"\u2014The Recording Academy, 2021[288]Swift's discography spans country, pop, folk, and alternative genres.[289][290] Her first three studio albums, Taylor Swift, Fearless and Speak Now are categorized as country;[291] her eclectic fourth studio album, Red, is dubbed both country and pop;[127] her next three albums 1989, Reputation and Lover are labeled pop; and Folklore and Evermore are considered alternative.[291] Music critics have described her songs as synth-pop,[292] country pop,[293] rock,[292] electropop,[294] and indie, amongst others;[295] some songs, especially those on Reputation, incorporate elements of R&B, EDM, hip hop, and trap.[296][297] The music instruments Swift plays include the piano, banjo, ukulele and various types of guitar.[298][299] Swift described herself as a country artist until the release of 1989, which she characterized as her first \"sonically cohesive pop album\".[300]Rolling Stone wrote, \"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\"[301] According to The New York Times, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country\u2014a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\u2014but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\"[302] The Guardian wrote that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.\"[303] With Folklore and Evermore, The New York Times found Swift turning into an \"indie-rock star\".[304] Consequence pinpointed her \"capacity to continually reinvent while remaining herself\",[305] while Time dubbed Swift a \"musical chameleon\" for the constantly evolving sound of her discography.[306] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[307]Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range.[308] Her singing voice is \"sweet but soft\" according to Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter.[309] Pitchfork's Sam Sodomsky called it \"versatile and expressive\".[310] Music theory professor Alyssa Barna described the timbre of Swift's upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and her lower register \"full and dark\".[311] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy.\"[312] In 2010, a writer from The Tennessean conceded that Swift was \"not the best technical singer\", but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got\".[313] According to Swift, her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career, and she worked hard to improve it.[314] She said she only feels nervous performing live \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\".[315] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals were \"fine\", but did not match those of her peers.[309]Though Swift's singing ability received mixed reviews early in her career, she was praised for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[316] Rolling Stone found her voice \"unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer\",[317] while The Village Voice noted the improvement from her previously \"bland and muddled\" phrasing to her learning \"how to make words sound like what they mean\".[318] In 2014, NPR Music described her singing as personal and conversational thanks to her \"exceptional gift for inflection\", but also suffered from a \"wobbly pitch and tight, nasal delivery\".[319] Beginning with Folklore, she received better reviews for her vocals; Variety critic Andrew Barker noted the \"remarkable\" control she developed over her vocals, never allowing a \"flourish or a tricky run to compromise the clarity of a lyric\", while doing \"wonders within her register\" and \"exploring its further reaches\".[320] Reviewing Fearless (Taylor's Version), The New York Times critic Lindsay Zoladz described her voice as stronger, more controlled, and deeper over time, discarding the nasal tone of her early vocals.[321] Lucy Harbron of Clash opined that Swift's vocals have evolved \"into her own unique blend of country, pop and indie\".[322]Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time and the best of her generation by various publications and organizations.[323][324][325] She told The New Yorker in 2011 that she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\"[11] Swift's personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate the complexities of life.[326][327] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[328][329] On her first three studio albums, recurring themes were love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective.[330][331] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[332] and embraced nostalgia and positivity after failed relationships on 1989.[333] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[334] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[335] Besides romance, other themes in Swift's music include parent-child relationships, friendships,[336][337] alienation, and self-awareness.[266][338]Music critics often praise her self-written discography,[339] especially her confessional narratives;[11][340] they compliment her writing for its vivid details and emotional engagement, which were rare among pop artists.[341][342] New York magazine argued that Swift was the first teenage artist who explicitly portrayed teenage experiences in her music.[343] Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[344] Although reviews of Swift are generally positive, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[11] Because of her confessional narratives, tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of the songs with ex-lovers of Swift, a practice New York magazine considered sexist as her male counterparts are not scrutinized like her.[341][345] Aside from clues provided in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about song subjects specifically.[346] In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Swift stated that the criticism on her songwriting\u2014critics interpreted her persona as a \"clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her\"\u2014was \"a little sexist\".[347]\"I love songwriting so much because there's an element to it that is still really mysterious\u2014like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you're not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that's where craftsmanship comes in; that\u2019s where you have the opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft.\"\u2014Swift on the art of songwriting, Variety[348]On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[349] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from the mental stress caused by tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[328] In a feature for Rolling Stone, Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success: \"I always thought, 'That'll never track on pop radio,' but when I was making Folklore, I thought, 'If you take away all the parameters, what do you make?\"[349] With the release of Evermore, Spin found Swift exploring \"exceedingly complex human emotions with precision and devastation\".[350] Consequence stated her 2020 albums \"offered a chance for doubters to see Swift's songwriting power on full display, but the truth is that her pen has always been her sword\" and that her writing prowess took \"different forms\" as she transformed from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult.\"[305]Swift's bridges have been underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs[351][305] and earned her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[352] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\" than Swift.[353] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times.[354] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[355]Swift has collaborated with many different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She has her own production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., which is credited with producing music videos for singles such as \"Me!\".[356] Swift developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\"[357] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White.[358] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[359]From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\u2014four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft.[360] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[361] She produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[362] While she continued to co-direct music videos with the Lover singles\u2014\"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch[363]\u2014she ventured into sole direction with the videos for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction), \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\".[364]Swift became a teen idol with her debut,[365] and a pop icon following global fame.[366] Billboard opined only few artists have had the chart success, critical acclaim and fan support that Swift wields.[367] Journalists have written about her polite,[33][41] \"open\" personality, \"willing to play along\" during the course of an interview. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post called Swift a \"media darling\" and \"a reporter's dream\".[339] The Guardian attributed her disposition to her formative years in country music.[368] The Hollywood Reporter described Swift as \"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\".[369] While presenting her with an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, former First Lady Michelle Obama described Swift as an artist who \"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\";[370] Swift considers Obama to be a role model.[371]Vanity Fair has referred to Swift as \"the most famous and influential entertainer on Earth\".[372] One of the most followed people on social media,[373] Swift is known for her frequent and friendly interactions with her fans online,[374][375] also delivering holiday gifts to them by mail and in person.[376] She considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.[377] Swift is known for regularly incorporating easter eggs into her works and social media posts for fans to discover clues about forthcoming releases.[378] Fawzia Khan of Elle attributes Swift's \"perennial\" success partly to her intimacy with fans.[289] YouGov surveys ranked Swift as the world's most admired female musician from 2019 to 2021.[379]Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businessperson as well.[381] According to marketing executive Matt B. Britton, her business acumen has helped her \"excel as an authentic personality who establishes direct connections with her audience\", \"touch as many people as possible\", and \"generate a kind of advocacy and excitement that no level of advertising could.\"[382] Inc. described Swift as an \"incredible flywheel\" of social media buzz and virtual word-of-mouth.[383] Describing her omnipresence, The Ringer writer Kate Knibbs said Swift is not just a pop act but \"a musical biosphere unto herself\", having achieved the kind of success \"that turns a person into an institution, into an inevitability.\"[339]Though Swift is reluctant to publicly discuss her personal life\u2014believing it to be \"a career weakness\"[384]\u2014it is a topic of widespread media attention and tabloid speculation.[385] Clash described her as a lightning rod for both praise and criticism.[386] The New York Times asserted in 2013 that Swift's \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether she was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\".[387]  Critics have highlighted the misogyny and slut-shaming her life and career have been subject to.[388][389] In the words of The Recording Academy's Robin Raven, Swift was \"mercilessly critiqued for writing about her feelings and relationships, while male musicians who do the same thing were rarely challenged.\"[390] Swift parodied the sexist scrutiny in \"Blank Space\".[note 5] Rolling Stone said, after the release of 1989, \"everything she did was a story\", with a non-stop news cycle about her that left her overexposed.[339] Much of Reputation was conceived under the \"intense\" media scrutiny she experienced in 2015 and 2016,[296] causing her to adopt a dark, defensive alter ego on the album.[392]  She criticized the double standards and gaslighting in \"The Man\" (2019) and \"Mad Woman\" (2020), respectively.[393] When asked \"why sing to the haters?\" by CBS journalist Tracy Smith, Swift replied, \"well, when they stop coming for me, I will stop singing to them.\"[394] Glamour opined Swift is an easy target for male derision, triggering \"fragile male egos\".[395] The Daily Telegraph said her antennae for sexism is crucial for the industry and that she \"must continue holding people to account\".[396]Swift's fashion is often covered by media outlets, with her street style receiving acclaim.[397] Her fashion appeal has been picked up by several media publications, such as People,[398] Elle,[399] Vogue,[400] and Maxim.[401] Vogue regards Swift as one of the world's most influential figures in sustainable fashion.[402] Elle highlighted the various styles she has adopted throughout her career, including the \"curly-haired teenager\" of her early days to \"red-lipped pop bombshell\" with \"platinum blonde hair and sultry makeup looks\" later on.[403] Swift is known for reinventing her image often, corresponding each one of her albums to a specific aesthetic.[404] She popularized Polaroid aesthetics with 1989,[405] and cottagecore with Folklore and Evermore.[406] Consequence opined that Swift's looks evolved from \"girl-next-door country act to pop star to woodsy poet over a decade.\"[305]Though labeled by the media as \"America's Sweetheart\",[407] a sobriquet based on her down-to-earth personality[408] and girl-next-door image,[409] Swift insists she does not \"live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\".[410] Although she refused to take part in \"sexy\" photoshoots in 2012,[411] she stated \"it's nice to be glamorous\" in 2015.[372] Bloomberg L.P. views Swift as a sex symbol, albeit of a subtle and sophisticated variety unlike many of her female contemporaries.[412]Swift has a well-documented cultural impact on the music industry.[413][289] She helped shape the modern country music scene.[414] Music journalist Jody Rosen writes, Swift is the first country artist whose fame reached the world beyond the U.S.[415] Her chart success extended to Asia and the U.K., where country music had previously not been popular.[414][415] She is one of the first country acts to use technology and online marketing techniques such as MySpace to promote their work.[30][48] According to Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly, the commercial success of her debut album helped the infant Big Machine Records go on to sign Garth Brooks and Jewel.[48] Following Swift's rise to fame, country labels became more interested in signing young singers who write their own music.[416] With her autobiographical narratives revolving around romance and heartbreak,[415] she introduced the genre to a younger generation that could relate to her.[413] Critics have since noted Swift's sound resonating in various albums released by female country singers like Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini.[417] Rolling Stone listed Swift's country music as one of the biggest influences on 2010s pop music,[418] and ranked her 80th in their 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time list.[419]Her onstage performance with guitars contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[420][421] Pitchfork opined, Swift changed the contemporary music landscape forever with her \"unprecedented path from teenage country prodigy to global pop sensation\" and a \"singularly perceptive\" discography that consistently accommodates both musical and cultural shifts.[422] Clash stated Swift's genre-spanning career encouraged her peers to experiment with diverse sounds.[307] Billboard credited her with influencing artists to take creative ownership of their music and remarked she \"has the power to pull any sound she wants into mainstream orbit\".[423] Music journalist Nick Catucci wrote, in being personal and vulnerable in her lyrics, Swift helped make space for later pop stars like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[424] According to The Guardian, Swift leads the rebirth of poptimism in the 21st-century with her ambitious artistic vision.[425]Publications consider Swift's million-selling albums an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[426][427] For this reason, musicologists Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold regard her as \"the last great rock star\".[428] Swift is the only artist to have four albums sell over one million copies in one week since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.[426] To New York magazine, her sales figures prove that she is \"the one bending the music industry to her will\".[427] The Atlantic notes that Swift's \"reign\" defies the convention that the successful phase of an artist's career rarely lasts more than a few years.[429] She is a champion for independent record shops,[430][431] and contributed to the 21st-century vinyl revival.[432][433] Journalists note how her actions have fostered debate

cited as an influence by numerous mainstream and indie music artists.[note 6] According to Billboard,[470] Business Insider,[439] and The New York Times, her albums have inspired an entire generation of singers and songwriters.[304] Various sources deem Swift's music to be representative and paradigmatic of the millennial generation, owing to her success, musical versatility, social media presence, live shows, and corporate sponsorship.[471] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\" for telling the stories of a generation through her songs.[472] She was named Woman of the Decade for the 2010s by Billboard,[473] became the first woman to earn the title Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[474] and received the Brit Global Icon Award \"in

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Old_Navy": "Old Navy is an American clothing and accessories retailing company owned by multinational corporation Gap Inc.[3] It has corporate operations in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The largest of the Old Navy stores are its flagship stores, located in New York City, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Manila, and Mexico City.In the early 1990s, Dayton-Hudson Corporation (then the parent company of Target, Mervyn's, Dayton's, Hudson's, and Marshall Field's) looked to establish a new division branded as a less expensive version of Gap called Everyday Hero;[4] Gap's then-CEO Millard Drexler responded by opening Gap Warehouse in existing Gap outlet locations in 1993.[5]On March 11, 1994, Gap Warehouse was renamed Old Navy Clothing Co. in order to establish a separate image from its parent company Gap Inc.[4][6] The new stores were about 15,000 square feet (1,400\u00a0m2), compared to less than 10,000 square feet (900\u00a0m2) for Gap Warehouse stores.[7] On March 11, 1994,[1] the first Old Navy locations opened in the northern California towns of Colma, San Leandro and Pittsburg.[7][8] According to Kevin Lonergan, Gap's director of stores, Old Navy stores were intentionally designed like grocery stores, with flowing aisles, shopping carts, and small impulse items near the checkout counters.[1] The cement floor, metal shelving, and checkout counters built from polished pressed board and galvanized metal gave the stores an industrial warehouse feel, while the colorful arrangements and large number of employees working set it apart from other discount clothing stores.[1][9] Later that year, 42 other Old Navy stores opened, and most of the 45 Gap Warehouse stores were renamed Old Navy.[7]Old Navy had campy television ads featuring Carrie Donovan,[10] Morgan Fairchild, and the mascot Magic, the dog.[11]The Old Navy division grew quickly; in 1997, it became the first retailer to pass $1 billion in its first four years in business, and opened 500 stores by 2000. In 2001, Old Navy began its international expansion with the opening of 12 stores in Ontario, Canada.[4]The brand also experimented, opening a coffee shop inside one location in San Francisco in December 1995,[12] and opening an Old Navy Kids location in Littleton, Colorado, in April 1997.[13] This in turn did not work out for the company, and was terminated the following September.In 2005, Old Navy's then-president Dawn Robertson looked to address the competition she saw in Hollister Co. and American Eagle Outfitters by rebranding the division with a \"high fashion feel\". In addition to a new logo, several locations were built or remodeled to reflect the \"New Old Navy\";[14] one such location in St. Petersburg, Florida cost roughly $5 million to develop. Unlike the traditional industrial warehouse style most Old Navy locations possess, the new stores were boutique in nature, featuring green building materials, rock gardens, large murals, and posters, as well as many mirrored and silver accents. Also, advertisements began to be created in-house, and substituted the original kitschy and humorous feel for a high fashion and feminine directive.[15] These stores proved to be a disappointing investment and Robertson was asked to leave the company.In 2011, Old Navy began a second rebranding to emphasize a family-oriented environment, known as Project ONE. It targets Old Navy's target customer (the fictional \"Jenny\", a married mother of at least one child) and features better lighting, vibrant colors, layouts that make shopping easier, quick-change stations, and a more efficient cash wrap design. By July 12, 2011, one third of the company's North American locations had adopted the redesign.[16]In 2012, after several years of Old Navy losing sales to rival retailer H&M, Gap Inc. hired H&M executive Stefan Larsson to run its Old Navy division. Larsson instituted a number of changes, including hiring designers away from Coach, Nike, Reebok, and North Face to design exclusive Old Navy clothing. By 2015, Old Navy's yearly sales had reached $6 billion per year in the United States, almost equaling those of Gap Inc.'s Gap and Banana Republic divisions combined.[17] Larsson left the company to join Ralph Lauren in 2015 and was replaced by current President and CEO, Sonia Syngal.[18]On October 26, 2017, Old Navy opened two new flagship stores (one in Times Square). The Times Square flagship caters to New York City crowds with extended store hours and significantly more retail space than the average Old Navy location.[19]On April 23, 2018, a customer, Saudia Scott filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Old Navy and its parent company Gap Inc. The lawsuit states that on July 25, 2016, Old Navy manager Megan Yost watched and assisted Scott with her purchases at the Old Navy store located in Abingdon, Harford County, Maryland.  As Scott walked to her car, two police officers followed, detained and returned Scott to inside the store after Yost falsely accused Ms. Scott of theft and shoplifting. Manager Yost was terminated almost immediately as a result.[20]In 2019, Gap Inc. announced that Old Navy will exit China in 2020.[21]On February 28, 2019, Gap Inc., announced that Old Navy and Gap Inc. would split into two companies, making Old Navy an independent company from Gap Inc.[22] The move was designed to enable the consolidation of the company's older brands, like GAP and Banana, with its newer Athleta and Hill City.[23] This decision was reversed on January 16, 2020, when Gap Inc. announced that the separation had been aborted.[24]On March 5, 2020, Gap Inc. announced it was temporarily closing its New York City offices until further notice after one of the retailer's employees was confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19.[25]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Grace_Thomas": "American Girl is an American line of 18-inch (46\u00a0cm) dolls released originally in 1986 by Pleasant Company (now Mattel). The dolls portray eight- to eleven-year-old girls of a variety of ethnicities. They are sold with accompanying books told from the viewpoint of the girls. Originally the stories focused on various periods of American history, but were expanded in 1995 to include contemporary characters and stories, the latest addition being WellieWishers, a line of 14.5-inch (37\u00a0cm) dolls aimed for younger children.Provided below is a list of characters from the Historical series (BeForever), Contemporary Characters, Girl of the Year, World by Us, and WellieWishers lines.2017\u20132019 (BeForever re-release)2014\u2013current (BeForever re-release)2018-2019 (BeForever re-release)The BeForever characters (originally known as \"The American Girls Collection\" or, colloquially, \"Historical Characters\") were initially the main focus of Pleasant Company. This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six book series from the perspective of a nine-year-old girl living in that time period. Although the books are written for a target market of eight-to-thirteen-year-old girls, they endeavor to cover topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, alcoholism, animal abuse, and war in a manner appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities of said market.[1]The first dolls in the American Girl/Historical line (Samantha, Kirsten and Molly) shared the same face mold but had different hair and eye colors. The first dolls were created with white muslin bodies, but these cloth bodies were changed in 1991 from a white muslin to a matching flesh tone. This accommodated the low necklines of Late Colonial/Revolutionary period gowns produced for the Felicity Merriman character (also introduced in 1991). Additional face molds were later developed for other dolls, and the line to date includes ten characters covering the period 1764 to 1986.The \"Best Friends\" line was introduced in 2004; supplemental characters from the core book series were created in doll form and marketed as \"best friends\" for some of the Historical Characters. These Best Friend dolls share the collections of the main characters, but each has her own book, and additional products were marketed under their names.[2] However, in May 2014, American Girl announced that Ruthie, along with Ivy, C\u00e9cile and Marie-Grace, will be retired from their historical roster, citing business reasons as they decided \"to move away from the character-friend strategy within the line\".[3]A reboot of the Historical Characters line dubbed as BeForever was launched in August 2014, complete with redesigned outfits, a two-volume compilation of previously-released books, and a \"Journey Book\" for each character, with players taking the role of a present-day girl who found her way to the past and met up with one of the Historical girls. The line also coincided with the relaunch of Samantha Parkington, whose collection had been discontinued in 2008.[4][5]Kaya is a young girl from the Nimiipuu or Nez Perce tribe living in the pre-contact Northwest. Themes in her core series focus on leadership, compassion, courage, and attachment. Chronologically, Kaya's adventures are the earliest of the historical characters. Kaya is depicted as brave and outgoing, but careless and thoughtless, and wants to be a leader of her people. Her role model is a female warrior named Swan Circling. Created in collaboration with a consultation team that included representatives from the Nez Perce tribe,[6] Kaya is the only Native American doll made by American Girl to date. Kaya is the only doll in the series not to show teeth, per tribal custom. Kaya is also the first doll in the series to not follow the book naming customs established by previously-released characters \u2013 the second book in the series is titled Kaya's Escape instead of Kaya Learns a Lesson.[7]Felicity Merriman is an auburn haired, horse-loving girl living in 1770s Williamsburg, Virginia, who is caught between Patriot and Loyalist family and friends at the onset of the American Revolution. Themes in her core books include loyalty and staying true to one's ideals.Felicity is depicted as spunky, brave, and free-spirited, and is often fed up with the customs that young women are expected to observe at the time, much to her mother's disappointment. She can be a little brash, impatient and foolish sometimes, and sets her heart on things often. She is also quite outspoken, but will stand up to bullies, as she did with Jiggy Nye. Felicity also is not afraid to tease Annabelle, her best friend Elizabeth's older sister, coming up with the name \"Bananabelle\". She eventually learns to be more ladylike throughout the series; however, she is still quite active.Many items from Felicity's collection were retired in the early 2000s, but when Felicity's core books were dramatized for Felicity: An American Girl Adventure on November 29, 2005, new products were introduced in her collection. On August 27, 2010, American Girl announced on its website that the Felicity and Elizabeth collection would be archived. On March 28, 2011, Felicity, Elizabeth and their respective collections were officially archived. In February 2017 Felicity was re-introduced as part of BeForever but then archived again in December 2019.[8]Elizabeth Cole is Felicity's best friend, despite her Loyalist family leanings during the American Revolution. In spite of being quiet and shy, she is known to poke fun at her older sister Annabelle with Felicity \u2013 this stems from being teased at by Annabelle, who gave her younger sister the nickname \"Bitsy\". Elizabeth is also shown to be somewhat wealthier, as evidenced by having a larger home, a larger garden, and fancier clothing.The Elizabeth doll was introduced in August 2005 as the second Best Friend doll with a book written by author Valerie Tripp, and the character was prominently featured in Felicity: An American Girl Adventure. In the original Felicity book illustrations, Elizabeth had brown hair and eyes but the character's appearance was revised to have blue eyes and blonde hair with the release of the Felicity DVD and Elizabeth doll. Later editions of the Felicity books were re-illustrated to reflect these changes and edit Elizabeth's physical description.[9] On August 27, 2010, American Girl announced that Elizabeth and her collection would be archived with Felicity, which took place in March 2011.Caroline Abbott is a girl from 1812 Sackets Harbor, New York.[10] The only daughter of a shipbuilder who owned a shipyard near Lake Ontario, Caroline enjoys outdoor activities, like sailing and ice-skating, and dreams of being a captain of her own ship.

Caroline was archived along with her collection in 2015. Her Mini Doll and books are still available  for purchase. American Girl has already created her BeForever version books.Josefina Montoya is a young Mexican girl living in 1824 New Mexico with her extended family. She and her family (including her oldest sister, Ana who is married to Tomas and has two sons, and her two other sisters, headstrong Francisca and practical and sensible Clara) must adapt following the death of their mother before the books and the introduction of their mother's sister, T\u00eda Dolores (who later marries Josefina's widowed father), to the family circle. Josefina dreams of becoming a healer like her grandmother and is taught this by her aunt, Magdalena, her father's sister. Josefina has a pet goat named Sombrita. Themes include adjustment to loss, the day-to-day life of the Mexican people, and the cultural and societal changes and influences that occurred once Mexico opened trade routes in collaboration with the US. Josefina's family speaks Spanish and there are Spanish words and phrases in her books that are defined in the glossary.Marie-Grace Gardner is a girl from 1850s New Orleans. Similar to Josefina, her mother died before the events of the series. She makes a friend with C\u00e9cile Rey in her first days in New Orleans, although the latter is not interested at first. However, changes are in the air. Soon, Marie-Grace's singing teacher is found sick with yellow fever. Her father, who is a doctor, saves not only the teacher, but others with his help. Marie-Grace also rescues a baby and forms a close bond with other children. Themes include the loss of family and caring for others in need. Both Marie-Grace and C\u00e9cile were archived in summer 2014. Though Marie-Grace and C\u00e9cile are best friends, they shared the same level of importance and a few items in their collection as well as a book, unlike other Best Friend characters. Marie-Grace was archived with Cecile, Ivy, and Ruthie in 2014 to make room for BeForever and the return of Samantha.C\u00e9cile Rey is from a rich African American family that originated from New Orleans, Louisiana. She loves listening to her grandfather's tales about the sea. She meets Marie-Grace during one of her singing lessons. At first, she is not fond of her because she is white, but eventually warms up to her and becomes her best friend. When yellow fever strikes her brother, she decides to use her gifts to help him and others. Themes include the loss of family and caring for others in need, and volunteering. Cecile speaks French and her French words are described in the glossary in the back of her book. Though C\u00e9cile Rey and Marie-Grace are best friends, they shared the same level of importance and a few items in their collection as well as a book, unlike other Best Friend characters. Cecile was the second African American character introduced by American Girl, the first being Addy and the third being Melody. Cecile was archived with Marie-Grace, Ivy, and Ruthie in 2014 to make room for BeForever and the return of Samantha.Kirsten Larson is a Swedish immigrant who settles in the Minnesota Territory with her extended family in 1854. She faces the hardships, challenges, and adaptations necessary to adjust to life in America such as learning to speak English. Kirsten begins to attend a single-room schoolhouse near her home and her and her family do their best to preserve their traditions from Sweden while adapting to American life. More changes include making a new friend outside of her own \"world\" and the arrival of a new baby. Kirsten was one of the first three dolls produced by American Girl in 1986. Unlike many of the dolls, Kirsten's books have maintained their original illustrations (with the exception of the covers). Kirsten was officially archived on the American Girl website on January 1, 2010.[11]Addy Walker was the fifth doll added to the Historical line. Her character is a fugitive slave who escapes with her mother from a plantation in North Carolina to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1864, during the American Civil War. Addy's stories explore themes of freedom, familial love, prejudice and racism. The six-book series was written by Connie Porter and originally illustrated by Melodye Rosales and Bradford Brown, but were later redrawn by Dahl Taylor. A stage adaptation of Porter's Addy book series was commissioned and produced by the Seattle Children's Theater in 2007.[12] Addy: An American Girl Story was subsequently taken on a limited national tour from January through May 2008 through Kids Entertainment, Inc. Addy was the first African American character made by American Girl, the second being Cecile and the third being Melody.Samantha is an only child growing up during the Edwardian period (although American Girl designated her as Victorian). Orphaned at age five and raised by her wealthy Victorian-era grandmother, Mary Edwards, whom she called Grandmary, in fictional Mount Bedford, New York, Samantha befriends a poor servant girl named Nellie O'Malley. Eventually Samantha, Nellie and Nellie's young sisters are adopted by Samantha's uncle Gardner Edwards and aunt Cornelia. The themes of Samantha's books include women's suffrage, child labor, and classism. Red Om Productions produced Samantha: An American Girl Holiday, in cooperation with American Girl. The show premiered on WB Television Network in November 2004 and was released to DVD soon thereafter. American Girl introduced the concept of \"archiving\" in October 2008 when it announced plans to cease production of Samantha and her collection (including Nellie). Samantha was then officially archived on May 31, 2009, but was later re-introduced in August 2014 as part of the BeForever reboot.[13][14]Nellie O'Malley, Samantha's best friend, is an Irish immigrant who works for Samantha's neighbors and is befriended by Samantha. She personifies the working-class immigrant experience of the time and teaches Samantha about the conditions faced by children who are part of the work force. Nellie and her sisters, Bridget and Jenny, are orphaned and later adopted by Samantha's relatives, Gardner and Cornelia Edwards. In 2004, American Girl introduced a new line of Best Friend dolls; Nellie O'Malley debuted as Samantha's Best Friend in conjunction with the Samantha DVD release. Nellie was marketed with a small collection of clothing and a book written by Valerie Tripp, Nellie's Promise, which chronicles the character's growth and adjustment to her recent adoption. As Nellie was part of Samantha's collection, she was archived at the same time as Samantha. In 2014, with the return of Samantha and the release of BeForever,  American Girl decided to move away from the Best Friends line. It is unlikely that Nellie will be re-released.Rebecca Rubin, American Girl's tenth historical character, debuted on May 31, 2009.

Kit hates change, and dislikes being dependent on charities, instead preferring to learn how to catch the big fish herself, which spurs her fascination with Amelia Earhart. She dreams of becoming a reporter one day. The books also depict her as being stubborn and somewhat fussy, as she finds chores around the house to be rather tedious, but eventually regrets it after realizing her family's misfortunes, and learns to be more supportive and helpful.Kit's core series of books was written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane. A feature film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl was released to theaters on July 2, 2008, starring Abigail Breslin in the title role.

The only daughter of a banker, Ruthie (and her family) is not financially affected by the Depression. Although they did at times offer help to the Kittredges, it was mostly in ways that would not hurt their pride. She is depicted to have an affinity for princesses and fairy tales, most especially Andrew Lang's Fairy Books and Grimms' Fairy Tales, in contrast to Kit's more tomboyish personality. Despite their major differences, Ruthie is a loyal and courageous friend who will go to great lengths to help Kit.Ruthie, along with Ivy, C\u00e9cile and Marie-Grace, was retired in August 2014 following the company's decision to discontinue the Best Friends line.[3]Nanea Mitchell is the sixteenth historical character and the 3rd BeForever exclusive.

Her father is stationed in England as a doctor caring for wounded soldiers, and her mother works at the Red Cross.

Molly also realizes that she, too, has a part of helping soldiers. Despite those changes, Molly has some leisure activities as well, such as skating, tap-dancing, movies and summer camp. Molly's series focuses on patriotism and the changes that come with wartime. Molly was one of the original three dolls offered by Pleasant Company and is the only historical character sold with eyeglasses. In early July 2013, American Girl announced plans to archive Molly and Emily.

Since Emily is a minor character and not Molly's best friend, she was marketed instead as \"Molly's English friend\". As Emily is a part of Molly's collection, she was archived along with Molly.Maryellen Larkin is the fourteenth Historical Character by American Girl, representing the 1950s.[20] She was released on August 27, 2015, and is the first exclusive BeForever character, and was made to replace Caroline Abbott.[21] Hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, Maryellen is an enthusiastic and imaginative girl, longing to stand out but often feels lost in the shuffle of her big, busy family.[22] Her favorite TV shows include Davy Crockett and The Lone Ranger, and she dreams up episodes where she gets to be the hero.

Wanting to save up for a new bike, Grace begins a small cupcake business with her friends Ella and Maddy, and it turns out to be successful. She plans to continue the business during the summer, but is asked by her mother to come with her on a trip to Paris, where Grace's aunt Sophie and uncle Bernard live and who are expecting a baby soon. That leaves Ella and Maddy to earn money another way, and they start a dog-grooming service called the Paw Spa.Bernard owns a p\u00e2tisserie in Paris, which becomes an opportunity for Grace to improve her baking skills. She realizes quickly that it will be a challenge to work for her uncle, while at the same time, she struggles to warm to her cousin Sylvie, who also works at the p\u00e2tisserie but is uncomfortable with the extra company. As Grace's efforts at the p\u00e2tisserie get her into trouble, her mother advises her to ask Bernard what he needs help with, rather than do things herself. During their free time, Grace and her mother sightsee around Paris, also visiting the Eiffel Tower with Sophie, Bernard and Sylvie. While there, Sophie goes into labor and needs to be driven to a hospital. She gives birth to a girl, naming her Lily. Grace welcomes her new cousin, while Sylvie feels reserved about her new sister.Lily's crying makes Grace and Sylvie restless, but it gives the two time to bond. They also help land an important client for the p\u00e2tisserie\u2014Jean-Luc Pernaud, the owner of a hotel Bernard has been seeking to do business with. While they use a local dog, whom Grace befriends and calls Bonbon, to deliver samples from the p\u00e2tisserie, Pernaud is impressed and asks Bernard to fulfill an order for the Bastille Day celebration. In preparing the treats, Bernard is concerned that the recipes are not up to the high standard needed for the occasion. As Grace has always gone strictly by the wording in recipes and has no idea how to improve the quality, her uncle uses the phrase je ne sais quoi to describe the unique ingredients that make a recipe stand out, and Grace sees its importance. Bastille Day becomes a success for the p\u00e2tisserie, despite worries from both Grace and her uncle. As Grace's trip in Paris comes to an end, Bernard tells her that she will keep learning the je ne sais quoi, as it differs for every recipe.When Grace returns home, she shares her experiences in Paris with Ella and Maddy, including what she learned from her uncle, but they are not cool when she talks business about their Paw Spa. Later, Grace is devastated to hear that her grandparents' bakery is going to shut down, due to a lack of customers. She comes up with a plan to save the bakery and asks Ella and Maddy to help, after apologizing over how she talked to them earlier. Her grandparents are delighted when business picks up, but then the oven fails, setting them back.Grace gets a huge break when she is selected to be a contestant on MasterChef Junior Baking Edition, unaware that her grandmother submitted an application on her behalf. The prize for winning is $100,000, enough to save the bakery and replace the oven. Despite gamesmanship from one of her competitors, requiring her to improvise her signature dessert, Grace makes it into the finals of the competition. Reminded about the je ne sais quoi lesson from her uncle in developing her next dessert, Grace impresses the judges again and wins.Bernard, Sophie, Sylvie and Lily fly to Bentwick to congratulate Grace, surprising her even more when Bonbon appears. The community, having watched Grace on Masterchef Junior, comes to support the bakery, with Bernard giving business a boost for the celebration.The direct-to-video film was released on video-on-demand services on June 9, 2015, and was released for DVD and Blu-ray on June 23.[1][8]A limited theatrical screening of the film was held at the Backus Community Center in International Falls, Minnesota on June 23, 2015. Similar film-viewing events were also held at all American Girl Place stores.[9]On June 11, 2016, Disney Channel premiered the film on television, due to Olivia Rodrigo (who starred on Bizaardvark, which premiered June 24 that year) starring in the film. It also appeared on Netflix, but Rodrigo\u2019s credit on the film was misspelled as \u201cOlivo Rodrigo\u201d.[10]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Disney_Channel": "Disney Channel (occasionally shortened as Disney) is an American pay television channel that serves as the flagship property of Disney Branded Television, a unit of the Disney General Entertainment Content division of The Walt Disney Company.[1] The channel was originally called The Disney Channel from 1983 to 1997, then shortened to \"Disney\" from 1997 to 2002, until settling with \"Disney Channel\".Disney Channel's programming consists of original first-run television series, theatrically-released and original made-for-TV movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel\u2013which formerly operated as a premium service\u2013originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later to younger children by the 2000s.As of May\u00a02022[update], Disney Channel is availible on basic cable and satellite in over 88 million homes in the US and to millions worldwide. There are 46 differnt versions of Disney Channel availible in 33 languages.Currently available on basic cable and satellite in over 88 million U.S. homes and to millions of other viewers on Disney Channels around the world. Disney Channel-branded content spans television, online, mobile, VOD platforms and the DisneyNOW app. There are 46 Disney Channels available in 33 languages worldwide.[2]The Disney Channel launched nationally as a premium channel at 7:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time on April 18, 1983.[3][4] The channel's development with help from the channel's founding president Alan Wagner, and formally announced the launch of its family-oriented cable channel in early 1983. The channel \u2013 which initially maintained a 16-hour-per-day programming schedule from 7:00\u00a0a.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time \u2013 would become available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states by September 1983, and accrue a base of more than 611,000 subscribers by December of that year.[3][5][6] In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, Tiger Town, which earned the channel a CableACE Award.[6] The channel had reached profitability by January 1985, with its programming reaching 1.75\u00a0million subscribers by that point.In September 1990, TCI's Montgomery, Alabama, system became the first cable provider to carry the channel as a basic cable service.[6] Between 1991 and 1996, a steadily increasing number of cable providers began shifting The Disney Channel from a premium add-on offering to their basic tiers, either experimentally or on a full-time basis; however, Walt Disney Company executives denied any plans to convert the channel into an ad-supported basic service, stating that the premium-to-basic shifts on some providers was part of a five-year \"hybrid\" strategy that allowed providers to offer the channel in either manner.[7][8][9] On April 6, 1997, the channel \u2013 which was officially renamed as simply Disney Channel.High School Musical 2 is currently the most successful DCOM in terms of popularity and accolades, setting a basic cable record for the single most-watched television program, as its August 2007 debut was watched by 17.2\u00a0 million viewers[10] (counting sports, this record stood until a December 3, 2007 telecast of a New England Patriots-Baltimore Ravens game on corporate sibling ESPN's Monday Night Football, which was watched by 17.5\u00a0 million viewers). The Cheetah Girls films were also notably successful in terms of merchandise and sales for its concert tour and soundtrack albums. The first film in 2003 was the first made-for-TV movie musical in Disney Channel's history and had a worldwide audience of over 84\u00a0million viewers. The second movie was the most successful of the series, bringing in 8.1 million viewers in the United States. An 86-date concert tour featuring the group was ranked as one of the top 10 concert tours of 2006; the tour broke a record at the Houston Rodeo that was set by Elvis Presley in 1973, selling out with 73,500 tickets sold in three minutes.In addition to its made-for-cable films, Disney Channel has rights to theatrically released feature films, with some film rights shared with sister network Freeform. Alongside films released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (mainly consisting of releases from Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar), the channel also maintains rights to films from other studios. Some films released by Bagdasarian Productions (such as The Chipmunk Adventure and Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein) have also aired on Disney Channel, although most of them are not currently owned by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.Disney Junior is a daily morning program block aimed at preschoolers. It's spiritual predecessor known as Playhouse Disney premiered on April 6, 1997 as part of Disney Channel's morning lineup. On May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of a new digital cable and satellite channel targeted for young children called Disney Junior, which debuted on March 23, 2012.[11] It is a commercial-free channel that competes with other preschooler-skewing cable channels such as Nick Jr. and Sprout (now Universal Kids).[33] The channel features programs from Disney Channel's existing preschool programming library and movies from the Walt Disney Pictures film library. Disney Junior took over the channel space held by Soapnet \u2013 a Disney-owned cable channel featuring soap operas \u2013 due to that genre's decline in popularity on broadcast television and the growth of video on demand, online streaming, and digital video recorders negating the need for a linear channel devoted to the soap opera genre. After a period during which cable providers unwilling to drop the network immediately retained it to prevent subscriber cancellations, Soapnet ceased all operations on December 31, 2013.[34] The former Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel rebranded as Disney Junior on February 14, 2011, along with the existing international channels. Disney-ABC Television Group once planned to launch a Playhouse Disney Channel in the United States in 2001, however it never happened despite launching internationally.[35]Disney XD is a digital cable and satellite television channel in the United States, which is aimed at boys and girls (originally aimed at young male audiences) aged 6\u201314.[36] The channel was launched on February 13, 2009,[37] and is the successor to Toon Disney; it carries action and comedy programming from Disney Channel and the former Jetix block from Toon Disney, alongside some first-run original programming and off-network syndicated shows. Like its predecessor Toon Disney, but unlike sister channels Disney Channel and Disney Junior, Disney XD operates as an ad-supported service. The channel carries the same name as an unrelated mini-site and media player on Disney.com, which stood for Disney Xtreme Digital, though it is said that the \"XD\" in the channel's name does not have an actual meaning.[38]Disney+ (launched in November 2019) is a subscription video on-demand streaming service owned and operated by the Direct-to-Consumer & International (DTCI) division of The Walt Disney Company. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, with the service advertising content from Disney's Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, and Star Wars brands in particular.[39][40]Toon Disney launched on April 18, 1998 (coinciding with the 15th anniversary of sister network Disney Channel's launch),[41] and was aimed at children and teenagers between the ages of 6 and 18. The network's main competitors at launch were Time Warner's Cartoon Network and Viacom's Nickelodeon. Toon Disney initially operated as a commercial-free service from April 1998 to September 1999, when it became ad-supported (unlike Disney Channel). The channel carried a mix of reruns of Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel-produced animated programming, alongside some third-party programs from other distributors, animated films, and original programming. In 2004, the channel introduced a nighttime program block aimed at children ages 7 to 14 called Jetix, which featured action-oriented animated and live-action series. During Toon Disney's first year on the air, Disney Channel ran a sampler block of Toon Disney's programming on Sunday nights for interested subscribers. The network's successor, Disney XD,  a channel also aimed at children, launched on February 13, 2009, and features a broader array of programming, with a heavier emphasis on live-action programs.Radio Disney launched on November 18, 1996, and aimed towards music programming is oriented towards children, pre-teens, and teenagers, focusing mainly on current hit music and a heavy emphasis on those signed with Disney Music Group record labels. On December 3, 2020, Disney announced the channel's closure in the first quarter of 2021.[42][43] On April 14, 2021, Radio Disney ceased broadcast when its last remaining terrestrial station.[44]The service is a successor to Disney Channel's original TV Everywhere service, \"Watch Disney Channel\", which launched in June 2012;[46][47] in September 2017, Disney replaced the separate apps for Disney Channel, Junior, and XD with a new app known as DisneyNow.[45][48]Anne Sweeney,[52] who was president of Disney Channel from 1996 to 2014, has been the target of criticism. Some critics have disapproved of the marketing strategy that was drafted during her tenure, which has resulted in the slanting of the target audience of Disney Channel's programs toward teenyboppers, as well as a decrease in animated programming and an increase in live-action shows and television films.[53] In 2008, Sweeney had explained that Disney Channel, resulting from its multi-platform marketing strategy using television and music, would become \"the major profit driver for the [Walt Disney] Company.\"[54]The channel has also pulled episodes (even once having to reshoot an episode) that have featured subject matter deemed inappropriate due to its humor, the timing of the episode's airing with real-life events, or subject matter considered inappropriate for Disney Channel's target audience. In November 2008, the Hannah Montana episode \"No Sugar, Sugar\" was pulled before its broadcast after complaints from parents who saw the episode through video on demand services due to misconceptions regarding diabetics and sugar intake (the Mitchel Musso character of Oliver Oken is revealed in the episode to have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes). Portions of that episode were subsequently rewritten and re-filmed to become the season three episode \"Uptight (Oliver's Alright),\" which aired in September 2009.[55]In December 2011, Disney Channel pulled episodes of two of its original series from the network's broadcast cycle \u2013 the season one Shake It Up episode \"Party It Up,\" and the So Random! episode \"Colbie Caillat\" \u2013 after Demi Lovato (star of So Random! predecessor series Sonny with a Chance, who was treated for bulimia nervosa in 2010) objected on Twitter to jokes featured in both episodes (the Shake It Up episode, in particular) that made light of eating disorders.[56][57][58][59] On May 17, 2013, the channel pulled \"Quitting Cold Koala\", a second-season episode of Jessie, prior to its scheduled premiere broadcast, due to parental concerns over a scene in which a character's gluten-free diet leads to him being ridiculed.[60]In 2010, Disney Channel All Star Party was released for the Nintendo Wii.[61] The four-player mascot party game, in which the stages resemble board games, features characters from Disney Channel programs such as Sonny with a Chance, Wizards of Waverly Place, and JONAS L.A. Several video games based on the Disney Channel animated series Phineas and Ferb were released by Disney Interactive Studios. The Disney Channel website also features various Flash games incorporating characters from the channel's various program franchises. There have also been games based on Kim Possible and Hannah Montana.Disney Channel has established its channels in various regions and territories worldwide, including Canada, Latin America & Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic & Hungary, Romania & Bulgaria, Poland, Scandinavia, Greece, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Israel, India and Japan. Channels for Italy, the UK & Ireland, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan used to be available, but were all shut down in the early 2020s with most content instead moving to Disney+. On March 10, 2022, the channel was closed in Russia due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[62] On March 21, 2022, it was announced that Disney Channel will be closed in Turkey with its content moving exclusively to Disney+,[63] it was later closed on March 31 before midnight.Disney Channel also licenses its programming to air on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States (formerly including Family Channel in Canada, for example), regardless of whether or not an international version of Disney Channel already exists in the country.",

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Disney%2B": "Disney+ is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned and operated by the Media and Entertainment Distribution division of The Walt Disney Company.[2] The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, with dedicated content hubs for the brands Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic, as well as Star in some regions. Original films and television series are also distributed on Disney+.Disney+ relies on technology developed by Disney Streaming Services, which was originally established as BAMTech in 2015 when it was spun off from MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI, as part of a corporate restructuring in anticipation of Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox.With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with Netflix ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows for exclusive release on the platform began in late 2017.Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, and expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later. It became available in select European countries in March 2020 and in India in April through Star India's Hotstar streaming service, which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Additional European countries received the service in September 2020, with the service expanding to Latin America in November 2020. The service will be expanded to South Africa in May 2022, followed by other countries of MENA and Eastern Europe in June 2022,[3] and Southeast Asian countries at the end of the year.[4]Upon launch, it was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems and missing content. Alterations made to films and television shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users had subscribed to Disney+ by the end of its first day of operation.[a] The service has 129.8 million global subscribers as of January 1, 2022.[6]In late 2015, Disney launched a streaming service in the United Kingdom called DisneyLife to test the streaming market.[7][8] It was eventually replaced by Disney+ on March 24, 2020.[9]In August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in BAMTech (a spin-off of MLB Advanced Media's streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, ESPN announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology (ESPN+) to supplant its existing linear television services.[10][11] On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%. Alongside the acquisition, the company also announced plans for a second, Disney-branded direct-to-consumer service drawing from its entertainment content, which would launch after the company ends its existing distribution agreement with Netflix in 2019.[12][13] Not long after, Agnes Chu, story and franchise development executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, was the first executive appointed for the unit, as senior vice president of content.[14] Chu led two projects to launch the new unit. First, Disney needed to verify exactly what content could be physically and legally made available through a streaming service right away, which meant physically reviewing all content in Disney's vaults that had not recently undergone restoration, and reviewing \"binders of pieces of paper with legal deals\" to identify potential obstacles.[15] Second, Chu met with leaders of Disney's various content-producing divisions to start brainstorming which projects would be appropriate for release on a streaming service rather than in movie theaters.[15] Chu later left in August 2020.[16]In December 2017, Disney announced its intent to acquire key entertainment assets from 21st Century Fox. Intended to bolster Disney's content portfolio for its streaming products,[17][18] the acquisition was completed on March 20, 2019.[19]In January 2018, it was reported that former Apple and Samsung executive Kevin Swint had been appointed as the senior vice president and general manager reporting to BAMTech CEO Michael Paull, who leads development.[20][21] In March 2018, Disney's top level segment division was reorganized with the formation of Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, which then included BAMTech, which contains \"all consumer-facing tech and products\".[22] In June of the same year, longtime Disney studio marketing chief, Ricky Strauss, was named president of content and marketing, however reporting to chairman of Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International Kevin Mayer.[23][24] In January 2019, Fox Television Group COO Joe Earley was named executive vice president of marketing and operations.[25] In June 2019, Matt Brodlie was named as senior vice president of international content development.[26] In August 2019, Luke Bradley-Jones was hired as senior vice president of direct to consumer and general manager of Disney+ for Europe and Africa.[27]On November 8, 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the service would be named Disney+ and that the company was targeting a launch in late 2019.[28] A September launch was reportedly planned,[29] but on April 11, 2019, Disney announced that Disney+ would launch on November 12, 2019, in the United States. Disney stated that it planned to roll the service out worldwide over the next two years, targeting Western Europe and Asia-Pacific countries by late 2019 and early 2020, and Eastern Europe and Latin America during 2020. The timing of international launches is subject to the acquisition or expiration of existing streaming rights deals for Disney content.[30] On August 6, 2019, Iger announced that it will offer a streaming bundle of Disney+, ESPN+, and the ad-supported version of Hulu for $12.99 per month available at launch.[31] At the D23 Expo in August 2019, Disney opened subscriptions to Disney+ at a discounted rate for three years.[32]On September 12, 2019, a trial version of Disney+ became available in the Netherlands with limited content available. This testing phase lasted until the official launch on November 12, when trial users were switched to a paid plan.[33][34] Disney+ became available for pre-order in September in the United States with a 7-day free trial upon launch.[35]In October 2019, Disney released a video that ran for three hours and eighteen minutes on YouTube to showcase their launch lineup.[36] It was also reported that Disney would ban advertisements for competitor Netflix from most of its TV platforms, except ESPN.[37][38]Disney+ launched on November 12, 2019, Midnight Pacific Time in the announced initial three launch countries.[39] The services had some issues the first day from logging in (about 33% of the problems), accessing specific content (about 66%), setting up profiles and watch lists. Some of the issues were due to third party devices.[40]On November 18, 2019, an investigation by ZDNet discovered that thousands of users' accounts were hacked using keystroke logging or info-stealing malware. Their email addresses and passwords were changed, \"effectively taking over the account and locking the previous owner out\", and their login information was put up for sale on the dark web.[41]On March 12, 2020, Vanessa Morrison, who previously served as President of Fox Family and 20th Century Animation, was appointed President of Streaming for Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production and will oversee development and production of Disney+ film content from The Walt Disney Studios for both Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios.[42] Morrison reports directly to President of Walt Disney Pictures Sean Bailey.[42]On October 12, 2020, Disney announced a reorganization of their media business with a greater focus on streaming. They are planning to add more content for Disney+ and their other streaming platforms (such as Hulu) in the future.[43]On December 10, 2020, Disney announced that a year after the launch of Disney+, it had over 86.8 million subscribers.[44] It was later announced that as of January 2, 2021, the platform had over 94.9 million subscribers.[45] In January of the same year, Ricky Strauss, who led Disney Plus\u2019 content curation and marketing efforts, exited the Walt Disney Company.[46]In March 2021, Disney announced an increase to the streaming service's pricing that would take place on March 26, 2021.[47] In the second quarter of 2021, Disney+ added 8.7 million subscribers.[48]In August 2021, Disney CEO Bob Chapek hinted that a possible Hulu/Disney+ merger could happen in the future to create an all-in-one streaming service on Disney+.[49] He mentioned that Disney might ditch its streaming bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ eventually. This is similar to the Star brand on Disney+ available in overseas markets outside of the United States.On March 4, 2022, Disney announced they will plan to launch a low-cost ad-supported version of Disney+ by late 2022 in the United States, with that version also expanding to other international territories in 2023.[50]The service is built around content from Disney's main entertainment studios and film and television library, including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disneynature, Disneytoon Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, 20th Century Animation, and Blue Sky Studios along with select films from 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, and Hollywood Pictures.[51] The service operates alongside Hulu, which Disney gained a controlling stake in following the 21st Century Fox purchase.[52] Bob Iger stated that at launch, Disney+ would focus on family-oriented entertainment (not carrying any content rated R, NC-17 or TV-MA) and that Hulu would continue to host general entertainment;[28][53][54] Hulu also hosts Disney+ as an add-on service.[55] Content intended for mature audiences was later added to the service, including the Disney+ original The\u00a0Beatles: Get\u00a0Back (2021), which includes a content warning,[56] and the Marvel series produced for Netflix, all of which are rated TV-MA.

The resulting changes allowed Disney to apply the existing audio, subtitle information, episode artwork, and other metadata from the episodes to both aspect ratios regardless of which is chosen by the user. Joe Rice, vice president of media product at Disney Streaming Services, added that these adjustments \"opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future.\"[144]In September 2020, the service added the GroupWatch feature which allows up to seven different Disney+ accounts to link up and co-view programming with one another.

Hotstar was acquired by Disney during the Fox purchase, and has been the dominant streaming service in the country.[209][210] However, it was postponed due to the Indian Premier League being rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[158] It was then launched on April 3, 2020.[157] Few months later, Disney+ launched in Indonesia through Hotstar on September 5, 2020.[170]On February 25, 2021, it was reported that Disney+ would launch in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand through Hotstar within 2021.[197][211] It was later confirmed that the launch would take place in Malaysia on June 1, 2021,[186] and Thailand on June 30, 2021.[189] The launch date for the Philippines has yet to be announced, tentatively by early 2022.[212] Later on, there was a report stating the service is expected to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam in 2022, but due to numerous delays on the launch, the plan has been shelved.[4]Star, Disney+'s brand for general entertainment content launched on February 23, 2021, in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore [213][214] Star was added to Disney+ in Japan on October 27, 2021, and launched along with the service in South Korea and Taiwan on November 12 and Hong Kong on November 16.[169]On November 13, 2019, a day after its launch, Disney announced that the streaming service had already signed up more than 10 million subscribers.[215][225] Disney+ has been well-received, thanks to its affordable price and for the extensive Disney library. Frank Pallotta of CNN stated that \"the company [Disney] has repackaged its trove of beloved content for the service makes it a worthy companion to the other services in the marketplace.[226] Nick Pino of TechRadar stated, \"If Disney keeps it updated with new content, Disney+ could rival Netflix sooner rather than later.\"[227]Upon launch, Disney+ experienced significant technical difficulties. Users complained about receiving error messages that the service was down and that they were \"unable to connect\", which were irritating because many of them had paid for the service months in advance.[228] In some instances, passwords needed to be reset to enable access.One other negative aspect with the launch of the service was the presentation of the non-HD episodes of The Simpsons. Namely, that instead of presenting them in their original aspect ratio, they were either cropped to fit 16:9 widescreen televisions or awkwardly stretched out to that aspect ratio.[145] FXX's now-defunct \"Simpsons World\" streaming service was similarly criticized when it launched.[229] In response, Disney stated they would make the ability to watch the episodes of the first 19 seasons and some from season 20 in either the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio in early 2020.[230] The feature was made available on May 28, 2020.[144]Some have noted that episodes of The Simpsons, X-Men, DuckTales, Phineas and Ferb, Kim Possible, and The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes are presented almost entirely out of order, while some series are missing episodes.[231][95] Others have questioned why an extensive catalog of Disney-owned material is missing from the platform, including older Disney-produced films,[65] Disney Junior titles,[232] Marvel content,[233][234] some Muppets media,[235][i] and the unreleased Star Wars animated comedy series Star Wars Detours.[238] On June 26, 2020, the 2017 DuckTales series had its episodes arranged in the proper order while co-creator of Phineas and Ferb, Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, has stated that they are working on correcting the order of his series.[239]Disney+ was the top trending Google search term in 2019 in the US.[240] In February 2020, Disney reported that Disney+ had 26.5 million subscribers by the end of 2019, and 28.6 million by February 3, 2020.[216] By April 2020, Disney+ had 50 million paid subscribers, with approximately 8 million of those coming from India.[217] The service had 54.5 million subscribers by May 4,[218][241] 57.5 million subscribers by the end of June, 60.5 million subscribers by August 4,[219] 73.7 million subscribers by September 30,[220] and 86.8 million subscribers as of December 2.[221] In February 2021, Disney reported that Disney+ had 94.9 million subscribers as of January 2, 2021.[242][243] On March 9, 2021, Disney reported that the service had surpassed 100 million paid subscribers but did not say when it had hit the milestone. The company clarified that it would now only be providing subscriber number updates when certain milestones are reached, as opposed to releasing exact numbers each quarter.[244]In 2020, Apple Inc. named Disney+ the Apple TV App of the Year. It was the second and third most-downloaded free app of the year globally on the iPad and iPhone, respectively. It was also voted the best app of 2020 by Google Play users.[245] In H1 of 2021, the app reached 125 million downloads.[246]",

It was performed by Rodrigo's character, Nina \"Nini\" Salazar-Roberts, in the fourth episode of the first season, \"Blocking\", which premiered on Disney+ on November 29, 2019.[1][2] A ballad with piano and strings,[1][3] \"All I Want\" was written in three days while Rodrigo was filming the first season.[2] The song was produced by Matthew Tishler and recorded live for the episode during filming.[4] It was released on November 27, 2019, through Walt Disney Records as a promotional single from the album High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Soundtrack.[5]Despite not being promoted as a radio single, \"All I Want\" was a minor hit;[6] it debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 in January 2020,[1] mainly due to downloads.[3] It was a trend on the social media platform TikTok[7][8] and has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America\u2014this success led to a contract with Interscope Records and the release of Rodrigo's debut single, \"Drivers License\", in 2021.[9] As of January 2021, \"All I Want\" is the most successful song from High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,[10] and has been described as its \"breakout hit\".[8]It's basically about Nini and, kind of, her boy troubles. She just found out that E.J. really betrayed her and did something really untrustworthy, so she's just grappling with that, and also looking back on her relationship with Ricky. I think it's a very relatable concept, at least for me.\"All I Want\" is a pop ballad[6] featuring piano and string instruments.[3] The song's arrangement was described as \"traditional, [1970s], singer-songwriter style, with a sprinkle of showtune sparkle\".[3] In an episode of Verified by Genius, Rodrigo explained that the line \"Is it something wrong with me?\" came from a conversation with her mother about relationships.[12] According to sheet music published by Hal Leonard LLC, \"All I Want\" is a moderately slow composition in E-flat major\u2013later modulating to F major\u2013with a mixed meter of alternating 34 and 44.[13]The scene with Rodrigo performing \"All I Want\" on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series was released to YouTube on the same day as its episode release.[14] A number of videos were additionally released via Disney Music's Vevo channel, including a lyric video,[15] an alternate video,[16] and a live studio performance.[17] Rodrigo performed the song on Live with Kelly and Ryan in February 2020,[4] and for Z100 New York the following month.[18] She also performed the song on the ukulele for Disney Channel's Summer Sing-Along on July 10, 2020.[19][20]A music video for \"All I Want\" was released on March 20, 2020 featuring Rodrigo playing a piano in a pink tulle dress with mountains in the background, accompanied by a string quartet.[21][22] Directed by Stephen Wayne Mallett, it was filmed at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Wendover, Utah.[23] A making-of for the music video and an American Sign Language version were also released.[23][24]Julia Lester covered \"All I Want\" as part of the #HSMTMTSCoverChallenge, where the cast members of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series covered songs originally performed by other characters.[25][26] \"All I Want\" was also covered by a cappella group DCappella,[27] and included on the track listing of their Japan-exclusive album All Ears, released in June 2020.[28]\"All I Want\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 in January 2020, and stayed on the chart for two weeks.[3][29] The song was not promoted as a radio single and its appearance on the chart was attributed mainly to download sales.[3] It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 23, 2020 for 500,000 digital units.[30] The success of Rodrigo's debut single \"Drivers License\" in early 2021 led to a resurgence of \"All I Want\" internationally, with a position of 119 on the Billboard Global 200 chart for the week ending January 30.[29] The song has reached the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart.[31][32]Credits adapted from Tidal.[34]Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\u00a0 Streaming-only figures based on certification alone.",

Its distribution ranked 4th in the US in 2019.[11]The Post was founded by Alexander Hamilton with about US$10,000 (equivalent to $162,860 in 2021) from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the New-York Evening Post,[12] a broadsheet. Hamilton's co-investors included other New York members of the Federalist Party, such as Robert Troup and Oliver Wolcott,[13] who were dismayed by the election of Thomas Jefferson as U.S. president and the rise in popularity of the Democratic-Republican Party.[14][full citation needed] The meeting at which Hamilton first recruited investors for the new paper took place in Archibald Gracie's then-country weekend villa that is now Gracie Mansion.[15] Hamilton chose William Coleman as his first editor.[14]The most famous 19th-century Evening Post editor was the poet and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant.[16] So well respected was the Evening Post under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, in 1864.[17]In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited William Leggett, the Locofoco Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's espoused a fierce opposition to central banking and support for the organization of labor unions. He was a member of the Equal Rights Party. Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the Post in 1831,[citation needed] eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.[18]Another co-owner of the paper was John Bigelow.[19] Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, John Bigelow, Sr. graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Society and the Philomathean Society,[20] and was admitted to the bar in 1838.[19] From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the Evening Post.[19]In 1881, Henry Villard took control of the Evening Post, as well as The Nation, which became the Post's weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of Carl Schurz, Horace White, and Edwin L. Godkin.[21] When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief.[22] White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.[23][24]In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, Oswald Garrison Villard,[25] a founding member of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People[26] and the American Civil Liberties Union.[27]Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during World War I hurt its circulation. The new owner was Thomas Lamont, a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of J.P. Morgan & Co. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a consortium of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by Edwin Francis Gay, dean of the Harvard Business School, whose members included Franklin D. Roosevelt. Conservative Cyrus H. K. Curtis,[28] publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, purchased the Evening Post in 1924[29] and briefly turned it into a non-sensational tabloid in 1933.[29] In 1928, Wilella Waldorf became drama editor at the Evening Post. She was one of the first women to hold an editorial role at the newspaper,[30] During her time at the Evening Post, she was the only female first-string critic on a New York newspaper.[31] She was proceeded by Clara Savage Littledale, the first woman reporter ever hired by the Post and the editor of the woman's page in 1914.[32]In 1934, J. David Stern purchased the paper, changed its name to the New York Post,[29] and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective.[33]In 1939, Dorothy Schiff purchased the paper. Her husband George Backer was named editor and publisher.[34] Her second editor and third husband Ted Thackrey became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942.[35] Together, they recast the newspaper into its modern-day tabloid format.[36] In 1948, The Bronx Home News merged with it.[37] In 1949, James Wechsler became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to Paul Sann and stayed on as editorial page editor until 1980.Under Schiff's tenure the Post was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most popular columnists of the time, such as Joseph Cookman, Drew Pearson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Max Lerner, Murray Kempton, Pete Hamill, and Eric Sevareid, in addition to theatre critic Richard Watts Jr. and gossip columnist Earl Wilson.In November 1976, it was announced that Australian Rupert Murdoch had bought the Post from Schiff with the intention she would remain as a consultant for five years.[38] It later emerged that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million.[10] The Post at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing World Journal Tribune; however, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the Post's profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. The paper has lost money ever since.[14]In late October 1995, the Post announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication schedule and begin issuing a Sunday edition,[39] which it last published briefly in 1989.[40] On April 14, 1996, the Post delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.[41] The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from The New York Daily News and The New York Times, was part of Post's efforts \"to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market\".[42][41]Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media cross-ownership after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now WNYW) and four other stations from Metromedia to launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow, a real-estate magnate with no news experience.[43] In 1988, the Post hired Jane Amsterdam, founding editor of Manhattan, inc., as its first female editor, and within six months the paper had toned down the sensationalist headlines.[44] Within a year, Amsterdam was forced out by Kalikow, who reportedly told her \"credible doesn't sell ... Your big scoops are great, but they don't sell more papers.\"[45]When Kalikow declared bankruptcy in 1993,[43] the paper was temporarily managed by Steven Hoffenberg,[43] a financier who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud,[46] and for two weeks by Abe Hirschfeld,[47] who made his fortune building parking garages. After a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership, which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead picture of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single teardrop running down his cheek,[48][49] the Post was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York Mario Cuomo, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. Without that FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down.[43] In December 2012, Murdoch announced that Jesse Angelo had been appointed publisher.[50]Various branches of Murdoch's media groups, 21st Century Fox's Endemol Shine North America and News Corp' New York Post created a Page Six TV nightly gossip show based and named after the Post's gossip section. A test run in July would occur on Fox Television Stations.[51] The show garnered the highest ratings of a nationally syndicated entertainment newsmagazine in a decade when it debuted in 2017.[52] With Page Six TV's success, the New York Post formed New York Post Entertainment, a scripted and unscripted television entertainment division, in July 2018 with Troy Searer as president.[53]In 2017, the New York Post was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. president Donald Trump,[54][55] who maintains frequent contact with its owner Murdoch.[55] The Post had promoted Trump's celebrity since at least the 1980s.[56] In October 2020, the Post endorsed Trump for re-election, citing his \"promises made, promises kept\" policy.[57] Weeks after Trump was defeated and he sought to overturn the election results, the Post published a front-page editorial asking the president to \"stop the insanity\", stating that he was \"cheering for an undemocratic coup\", commenting: \"If you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down, that will be how you are remembered. Not as a revolutionary, but as the anarchist holding the match.\" The Post characterized Trump attorney Sidney Powell as a \"crazy person\", and his former national security advisor Michael Flynn\u2019s suggestion to declare martial law as \"tantamount to treason.\"[58][59]Around March 2021, Keith Poole, a top editor at The Sun, another Murdoch-owned tabloid, was appointed as the editor in chief[60] at the New York Post.[61][62] Around the same time, at least eight journalists had left the paper.[62]The Post has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservatism bias. In 1980, the Columbia Journalism Review stated that the \"New York Post is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem\u2014a force for evil.\"[63]The Post has been accused of contorting its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular avoiding subjects which could be unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.[64]In a 2019 article in The New Yorker, Ken Auletta wrote that Murdoch \"doesn't hesitate to use the Post to belittle his business opponents\", and went on to say that Murdoch's support for Edward I. Koch while he was running for mayor of New York \"spilled over onto the news pages of the Post, with the paper regularly publishing glowing stories about Koch and sometimes savage accounts of his four primary opponents.\"[65]According to The New York Times, Ronald Reagan's campaign team credited Murdoch and the Post for his victory in New York in the 1980 United States presidential election.[66] Reagan later \"waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market\", allowing Murdoch to continue to control the New York Post and The Boston Herald while expanding into television.In 1997, Post executive editor Steven D. Cuozzo responded to criticism by saying that the Post \"broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda.\"[67]In a 2004 survey conducted by Pace University, the Post was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it \"not credible\" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).[68]The Post commonly publishes news reports based entirely on reporting from other sources without independent corroboration. In January 2021, the paper forbade the use of CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, and The New York Times as sole sources for such stories.[69]Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as The Sun, which remains one of the highest selling daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. This style was typified[70] by the Post's famous headlines such as \"Headless body in topless bar\" (written by Vincent Musetto). In its 35th-anniversary edition, New York magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other Post headlines in its \"Greatest Tabloid Headlines\" list.[71]The Post has also been criticized for incendiary front-page headlines, such as one referring to the co-chairmen of the Iraq Study Group\u2014James Baker and Lee Hamilton\u2014as \"surrender monkeys\",[72] and another on the murder of Hasidic landlord Menachem Stark reading \"Slumlord found burned in dumpster. Who didn\u2019t want him dead?\"[73]The gossip section \"Page Six\" was created by James Brady[74] and is currently edited by Emily Smith[75] Columnist Richard Johnson edited Page Six for 25 years.[76] February 2006 saw the debut of Page Six Magazine, distributed free inside the paper. In September 2007, it started to be distributed weekly in the Sunday edition of the paper. In January 2009, publication of Page Six Magazine was cut to four times a year.[77]Beginning with the 2017\u201318 television season, a daily syndicated series known as Page Six TV came to air, produced by 20th Television, which was part of the 21st Century Fox side of Rupert Murdoch's holdings, and Endemol Shine North America. The show was originally hosted by comedian John Fugelsang, with contributions from Page Six and Post writers (including Carlos Greer), along with regular panelists Elizabeth Wagmeister from Variety and Bevy Smith. In March 2018, Fugelsang left the show, with the expectation that a new host would be named, though by the end of the season, it was announced that Wagmeister, Greer and Smith would be retained as equal co-hosts.[78]In April 2019, it was confirmed that the series would end after May 2019; by then, it was last in average viewership out of all U.S. syndicated newsmagazine programs, behind the similar tabloid-inspired program Daily Mail TV.[79]Richard Jewell, a security guard wrongly suspected of being the Centennial Olympic Park bomber, sued the Post in 1998, alleging that the newspaper had libeled him in several articles, headlines, photographs, and editorial cartoons. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska largely denied the Post's motion to dismiss, allowing the suit to proceed.[80] The Post subsequently settled the case for an undisclosed sum.[81]In several stories on the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the Post inaccurately reported that twelve people had died, and that a Saudi national had been taken into custody as a suspect, which was denied by Boston Police.[82][83] Three days later, on April 18, the Post featured a full-page cover photo of two young men at the Boston marathon with the headline \"Bag Men\" (a term that implies criminality) and erroneously claimed they were being sought by police.[83][84][85] The men, Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi, were not considered suspects, and the Post was heavily criticized for the apparent accusation.[84][86] Then-editor Col Allan defended the story, saying they had not referred to the men as \"suspects\".[84][87] The two men later sued the Post for libel,[88][89][90] and the suit was settled in 2014 on undisclosed terms.[91][92][93]In 1989, the Post described the five black and Latino teenagers arrested following the rape and assault of a white woman in Central Park as coming \"from a world of crack, welfare, guns, knives, indifference, and ignorance [...] a land of no fathers\", and having set out \"to smash, hurt, rob, stomp, rape\" people who were \"rich\" and \"white\".[94][95][96] The teenagers\u2019 convictions were later overturned after the confession of a serial rapist, which was confirmed with DNA evidence.In 2006, several Asian-American advocacy groups protested the use of the headline \"Wok This Way\" for a Post article about U.S. president George W. Bush's meeting with Hu Jintao, President of the People's Republic of China.[97]In 2009, the Post ran a cartoon by Sean Delonas of a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a chimpanzee on the street: \"They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.\" The cartoon dually referred to U.S. president Obama and to the recent rampage of Travis, a former chimpanzee actor. It was criticized as racist,[98] with civil rights activist Al Sharpton calling the cartoon \"troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.\"[99] The Post defended itself by stating that the cartoon was deliberately misinterpreted by its critics.[100]The Public Enemy song \"A Letter to the New York Post\" from their album Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.[citation needed]In 2019, the Post displayed an image of the World Trade Center in flames targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. A quote by Representative Omar was included.[101] The Yemeni American Merchant Association announced a formal boycott of the paper and ten of the most prominent Yemeni bodega owners in New York agreed to stop selling the paper. As of June 2019, the boycott had extended to over 900 individual stores.[102] Yemeni-Americans own about half of the 10,000 bodegas in New York City.[103]In 2020, the Post published an article with the headline \"Suspected teen gunman Kyle Rittenhouse spotted cleaning Kenosha graffiti before shooting\". In response, actress Viola Davis posted a photo on Instagram comparing the headline with the Post's 2012 headline about Trayvon Martin, which read: \"Trayvon Martin had traces of marijuana in system at time of death, autopsy reveals.\" The caption stated: \"We need to boycott publications that continue to criminalize innocent [people of color] after they have been murdered by the law!!!\"[104]On October 14, 2020, three weeks before the 2020 United States presidential election, the Post published a front-page story purporting to reveal \"smoking gun\" emails recovered from a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden at a computer repair store in Wilmington, Delaware.[105] The only sources named in the story were Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and strategy advisor Steve Bannon.[105] The story came under heavy criticism from other news sources and anonymous reporters at the Post itself for \"flimsy\" reporting, including questions about the reliability of its sourcing and the lack of outreach to either Hunter Biden or the Joe Biden campaign for pre-publication comment.[106][107] More than fifty former U.S. intelligence officials signed an open letter stating that they were \"deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role\" in the story, but emphasized that \"we do not know if the emails\u00a0... are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement.\"[108][109] The Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe asserted during a Fox News interview that \"the intelligence community doesn\u2019t believe that [the emails originated from Russian disinformation] because there is no intelligence that supports that.\" Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, had previously made public assertions that contradicted professional intelligence assessments.[110][111] The FBI took possession of the laptop in late 2019 and reported that they had \"nothing to add\" to Ratcliffe's remarks concerning Russian disinformation.[112] The New York Times reported days after the Post story that \"no concrete evidence has emerged that the laptop contains Russian disinformation.\" Amid mounting pressure, the FBI wrote to Senator Ron Johnson and suggested it had not found any Russian disinformation on the laptop. It was unclear what the Justice Department officials knew about the FBI investigation at the time.[112] Fox News reported that the laptop was seized as part of an investigation into money laundering, but did not make clear if the investigation involved Hunter Biden.[113] The New York Times reported in December 2020 that investigators had initially examined possible money laundering by Hunter Biden but did not find evidence to justify further investigation.[114] As of 2022, Vox reported that no evidence had emerged \"that the laptop's leak was a Russian plot.\"[115] In March 2022, The New York Times and The Washington Post confirmed that some of the emails were authentic.[116][117][118] Also in March, after the publishing of the Times article, the Murdoch-owned The Wall Street Journal editorial board criticized the media for ignoring the Hunter Biden laptop story, saying \"The media excuse that it ignored the laptop because of \"uncertainty about its provenance\" is hogwash. We all know that if a similar story had emerged about the Trump family, even with no credible source, the mainstream media would have run it nonstop.\"[119]After the 2016 election, social media companies were criticized for allowing false political information to proliferate on their platforms, including from Russian intelligence, suggesting it may have assisted Trump's election.[120] Twitter and Facebook initially limited the spread of the Post story on their platforms, citing supposed policies restricting the sharing of hacked material and personal information; Twitter also temporarily suspended the Post's account. this decision proved controversial, with many critics, including Republican senator Ted Cruz, deriding it as censorship.[121][122] NPR reported that Twitter initially declined to comment how it reached this decision or what evidence it had supporting this.[122] The New York Times initially reported that the story had been pitched to other outlets, including Fox News, which declined to publish it due to concerns over its reliability.[123] The Times also reported that two writers at the Post declined to have their names attached to the story, and ultimately the story only listed two bylines: Gabrielle Fonrouge, who \"had little to do with the reporting or writing of the article\" and was unaware of her byline prior to the story's publication, and Emma-Jo Morris, a former producer for Fox News's Hannity who had no prior bylines with the Post. In response to the concerns about the veracity of the article, former Post editor-in-chief and current advisor Colin Allan responded in an email to the Times that  \u201cthe senior editors at The Post made the decision to publish the Biden files after several days\u2019 hard work established its merit.\" Giuliani said he gave the story to the Post because \"either nobody else would take it, or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.\"[123]NBC News reported on November 1 that \"no evidence has emerged that the documents are the product of Russian disinformation, as some experts initially suggested, but many questions remain about how the materials got into the hands of Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has met with Russian agents in his effort to dig up dirt on Biden.\"[124] CNN reported that Giuliani and other Trump allies met with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, whom the U.S. government later assessed was a longtime Russian intelligence agent, sanctioning him for distributing disinformation about Joe Biden.[125] Earlier in September 2020, the New York Post itself reported that Derkach was a \"pro-Russian member of Kiev's parliament\" and stated \"Derkach also met with former New York Mayor Giuliani in Kiev in December last year to dig up dirt on Biden.\"[126]In 1997, a national news story concerning Rebecca Sealfon's victory in the Scripps National Spelling Bee circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the Daily News, a direct in-market competitor. The Post published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the Daily News as printed on a placard she was wearing.[127]In 2004, the Post ran a full-page cover photo of 19-year-old New York University student Diana Chien jumping to her death from the twenty-fourth story of a building.[128][129]In 2012, the Post was criticized for running a photograph of a man struggling to climb back up onto a subway platform as a train approached, along with the headline \"DOOMED.\"[130][131][132] Facing questions over why he didn't help the man, the photographer claimed he was not strong enough and had been attempting to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train.[133]In December 2020,[134] the Post published a story outing an emergency medical technician who made additional income from posting explicit photographs of herself to the subscription website OnlyFans.[135][136] The publication was widely criticized on social media as \"doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living.\"[135]In April 2021, Facebook blocked users from sharing a Post story about Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors using millions of dollars to buy several homes, saying that it violated its privacy and personal information policy.[137][138] In response, the Post argued that it was an arbitrary decision since other newspapers, magazines and websites highlight the real estate purchases of high status individuals.[139] News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern also voiced criticism of the decision, saying in a prepared statement: \"There is no balance of power between \u2018media\u2019 and 'Big Tech.'\"[140]In April 2021, the Post published a false front-page story asserting that copies of a book by vice president Kamala Harris were being distributed to migrant children at an intake facility in Long Beach, California.[141] Fox News then published a story about the matter, followed by numerous Republican politicians and pundits commenting on it, in some cases speculating that taxpayers were funding the supposed book handouts for Harris's personal profit.[141][142] Responding to questions from Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy, White House press secretary Jen Psaki expressed no knowledge of the matter; the Post then published a new story headlined \"Psaki has no answers when asked about Harris' book being given to child migrants.\"[143] Four days after the original publication, the Post replaced the story with a new version clarifying that just one Harris book had been donated by a community member but maintained that it was an \"open-arms gesture by the Biden administration\", though there was no evidence of the administration's involvement.[143] Laura Italiano, the author of the story, resigned that day, asserting she had been \"ordered\" to write it.[62][143]The 1801-established newspaper describes itself as the oldest continuously published daily U.S. newspaper. However, the New York Post halted publication during strikes in 1958 and in 1978. Therefore, The Providence Journal is understood as the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the U.S. While it began daily publication on July 21, 1829 (28 years after the New York Post), it has not halted daily publication once since its founding, unlike the New York Daily Post.[144]The Hartford Courant, generally understood to be the oldest continuously published newspaper in America, was founded in 1764; however, it was founded as a semi-weekly paper and did not begin publishing daily until 1836, 35 years after the New York Post began doing so, and cannot be considered a true challenge to the New York Post claim as \"the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper\", despite it being an older continuously published paper than the New York Post. The New Hampshire Gazette trademarked its claim of being The Nation's Oldest Newspaper, as it was founded in 1756; however, it was founded as a weekly paper and since the 1890s has only published on the weekends. To date, The New Hampshire Gazette has never published daily and therefore cannot be considered a challenger to the Providence Journal and New York Post claims to being the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper.[145]The 1906 Old New York Evening Post Building is a designated landmark. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[146] It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the Post was established at 75 West Street in the New York Evening Post Building. The building remained in use by the Post until 1970, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[146] In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the New York Journal American, which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the Post. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated Post's news and business offices to the News Corporation headquarters tower at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan. The Post shares this building with Fox News Channel and The Wall Street Journal, both of which are also owned by Murdoch. Both the Post and the New York City edition of the Journal are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of The Bronx.[citation needed]The Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union has been delivering the newspaper \"since the early 1900s.\"[147]In 1996, the New York Post launched an Internet version of the paper.[148][149] In 2014, it launched the website Decider, which provides recommendations for streaming services.[150]The daily circulation of Post decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 around 1967\u201368, to approximately 517,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976.[151] Under Murdoch, the Post launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid Daily News in 1978, prompting the Daily News to retaliate with a PM edition called Daily News Tonight. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon Post experienced and the Daily News ultimately folded Tonight in 1981.[152] By that time, circulation of the all-day Post soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition (It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977, with the news of the arrest the night before of David Berkowitz, the infamous \"Son of Sam\" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer). However, the Post lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down the Post's PM edition in 1982, turning the Post into a morning-only daily.[citation needed]The Post and the Daily News have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw Post circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007,[2] achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, the Post surpassed the Daily News in circulation for the first time, only to see the Daily News overtake its rival a few months later.[153] In 2010, the Post's daily circulation was 525,004, just 10,000 behind the Daily News.[154] As of 2017[update], the Post was the fourth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, while the Daily News was ranked eighth.[155]The Post has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976, and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that Post loses up to $70 million a year.[156] One commentator has suggested that the Post cannot become profitable as long as the competing Daily News survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the Daily News to fold or sell out, leaving the two papers in an intractable war of attrition.[157]",

It is set to conclude in London on July 7, comprising 48 shows.[2] Gracie Abrams, Holly Humberstone, Chappell Roan, and Baby Queen will serve as opening acts.[3]In July 2021, Billboard reported that the singer would be unable to embark on a tour until next year due to her television commitments and her contract with Disney.[4][5] An official concert cycle was announced through social media on December 6, with tickets going on sale four days later.[6]Tickets for the tour went on sale December 10 for fans who were chosen for \"Verified Fan\" registration.[7] Tickets sold out in minutes, although many attributed this to ticket scalpers, with some tickets being listed on secondhand sites for more than $9,000 within minutes of tickets going on sale.[8][9] Many fans and media outlets criticized the choosing of smaller venues over arenas, citing it as the reason many fans were unable to secure tickets.[10][11] Rodrigo defended her decision to perform at smaller venues, telling the Los Angeles Times \"I don\u2019t think I should skip any steps\" and assuring fans \"there will be more tours in the future.\"[12][13]This set list is representative of the show on April 5, 2022, in Portland.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mastering_(audio)": "Mastering, a form of audio post production, is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or replication). In recent years digital masters have become usual, although analog masters\u2014such as audio tapes\u2014are still being used by the manufacturing industry, particularly by a few engineers who specialize in analog mastering. [1]Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results depend upon the intent of the engineer, the skills of the engineer, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. Mastering engineers often apply equalization and dynamic range compression in order to optimize sound translation on all playback systems.[2] It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording\u2014known as a safety copy\u2014in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.In the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the diaphragm of the recording horn to the mastering lathe, typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc.[3] These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from wax; this gave rise to the colloquial term waxing, referring to the cutting of a record.[4]After the introduction of the microphone and electronic amplifier in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut direct-to-disc.[3] Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.In the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of magnetic tape. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898.  Not until the end of World War II could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.[3]Although tape and other technical advances dramatically improved the audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media\u2014the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm LP record\u2014meant that the audio quality, dynamic range,[a] and running time[b] of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the compact disc.From the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final mix was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track mono or two-track stereo tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist mastering engineer.After the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands (equalization) prior to the cutting of the master disc.In large recording companies such as EMI, the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in multi-track recording[c] and did not install 8-track recorders in their Abbey Road Studios until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.[5]In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on hard disk drives or digital tape and mastered to CD. The digital audio workstation (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a graphical user interface (GUI).  Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of digital technology compared to analog technology are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.[2]Digital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. When mixing to 24-bits with peaks between -3 and -10 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough headroom to process and produce a final master.[6] It is important to allow enough headroom for the mastering engineer's work.[7] Reduction of dynamics by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a loudness war in commercial recordings.[8]The source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using equalization, compression, limiting and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, noise reduction and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage.[8] The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or 'track') sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.If the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency-dependent stereo\u2013to\u2013mono fold-down and equalization may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. For compact disc release, start of track, end of track, and indexes are defined for playback navigation along with International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a Disc Description Protocol (DDP) file set or an ISO image. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator factory will transfer the audio to a glass master that will generate metal stampers for replication.The process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.Steps of the process typically include the following:Examples of possible actions taken during mastering:[8]",

Eventually, leading to Rodrigo's number one single \u201cDrivers License.\u201d[6]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Spotify": "Spotify (/\u02c8sp\u0252t\u026afa\u026a/; Swedish: [\u02c8sp\u0254\u0302t\u02d0\u026afaj]) is a proprietary Swedish[3] audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon.[7] It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 422 million monthly active users, including 182 million paying subscribers, as of March 2022.[8] Spotify is listed (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled holding company, Spotify Technology S.A.[1]) on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies.[8] As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries, as of October 2021. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.Spotify is available in most of Europe, as well as the Americas and Oceania, with a total availability in 184 markets.[9]  The service is available on most devices including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers, iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, smart home devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Nest lines of products and digital media players like Roku.[10]Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often record labels), who then pay artists based on individual agreements.[11] According to Ben Sisario of The New York Times, approximately 13,000 out of seven million artists on Spotify generated $50,000 or more in payments in 2020.[12]Spotify was founded in 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden,[13] by Daniel Ek, former CTO of Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of Tradedoubler.[14][15] According to Ek, the company's title was initially misheard from a name shouted by Lorentzon. Later they thought out a portmanteau of \"spot\" and \"identify.\"[16]In February 2009, Spotify opened public registration for the free service tier in the United Kingdom.[14] Registrations surged following the release of the mobile service, leading Spotify to halt registration for the free service in September, returning the UK to an invitation-only policy.[17]Spotify launched in the United States in July 2011, and offered a six-month, ad-supported trial period, during which new users could listen to an unlimited amount of music for free. In January 2012, the free trial periods began to expire, and limited users to ten hours of streaming each month, and five plays per song.[18] Later that same year, in March, Spotify removed all limits on the free service tier indefinitely.[19]In April 2016, Ek and Lorentzon wrote an open letter to Swedish politicians, demanding action in three areas that they claimed hindered the company's ability to recruit top talent as Spotify grows, including access to flexible housing, better education in the programming and development fields, and stock options. Ek and Lorentzon wrote that to continue competing in a global economy, politicians needed to respond with new policies, or else thousands of Spotify jobs would be moved from Sweden to the United States.[20]In February 2017, Spotify announced expansion of its United States operations in Lower Manhattan, New York City, at 4 World Trade Center, adding approximately 1,000 new jobs and retaining 832 existing positions.[21] The company's US headquarters are located in New York City's Flatiron District.[22]On 14 November 2018, the company announced a total of 13 new markets in the MENA region, including the creation of a new Arabic hub and several playlists.[23]In October 2015, \"Thinking Out Loud\" by Ed Sheeran became the first song to pass 500 million streams.[24] A month later, Spotify announced that \"Lean On\" by Major Lazer and DJ Snake featuring M\u00d8 was its most-streamed song of all time with over 525 million streams worldwide.[25] In April 2016, Rihanna overtook Justin Bieber to become the biggest artist on Spotify, with 31.3 million monthly active listeners.[26] In May 2016, Rihanna was overtaken by Drake with 31.85 million total streams.[27] In December 2016, Drake's just-under 36 million monthly listeners were overtaken by the Weeknd's 36.068 million.[28] Later that same month, Drake's song \"One Dance\" became the first song to hit one billion streams on Spotify.[29][30] Upon its release in August 2017, the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" by Taylor Swift earned over eight million streams within 24 hours, breaking the record for the most single-day streams for a track.[31] On 19 June 2018, XXXTentacion's hit single \"Sad!\" broke Swift's single-day streaming record, amassing 10.4 million streams the day after he was fatally shot in Florida.[32]In March 2011, Spotify announced a customer base of 1 million paying subscribers across Europe,[33] and by September 2011, the number of paying subscribers had doubled to two million.[34] In August 2012, Time reported 15 million active users, four million being paying Spotify subscribers.[35] User growth continued, reaching 20 million total active users, including five million paying customers globally and one million paying customers in the United States, in December 2012.[36] By March 2013, the service had 24 million active users, six million being paying subscribers,[37] which grew to 40 million users (including ten million paying) in May 2014,[38] 60 million users (including 15 million paying) in December 2014, 75 million users (20 million paying) in June 2015, 30 million paying subscribers in March 2016,[39] 40 million paying subscribers in September 2016,[40] and 100 million total users in June 2016.[41] In April 2020, Spotify reached 133 million premium users.[42] In countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, Spotify registered a fall in users in late February, but it has seen a recovery.[43]The Financial Times reported in March 2017 that, as part of its efforts to renegotiate new licensing deals with music labels, Spotify and major record labels had agreed that Spotify would restrict some newly released albums to its Premium tier, with Spotify receiving a reduction in royalty fees to do so. Select albums would be available only on the Premium tier for a period of time, before general release. The deal \"may be months away from being finalized, but Spotify is said to have cleared this particular clause with major record labels\".[44][45][46] New reports in April confirmed that Spotify and Universal Music Group had reached an agreement to allow artists part of Universal to limit their new album releases to the Premium service tier for a maximum of two weeks. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek commented that \"We know that not every album by every artist should be released the same way, and we've worked hard with UMG to develop a new, flexible release policy. Starting today, Universal artists can choose to release new albums on premium only for two weeks, offering subscribers an earlier chance to explore the complete creative work, while the singles are available across Spotify for all our listeners to enjoy\".[47][48][49] It was announced later in April that this type of agreement would be extended to indie artists signed to the Merlin Network agency.[50][51]Spotify went public on the stock market in April 2018 using a direct public offering rather than an initial public offering. This approach is not intended to raise fresh capital, but to let investors get their returns.[52][53][54] Morgan Stanley is the company's slated advisor on the matter.[54]After making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on 3 April 2018, CNBC reported that Spotify opened at $165.90, more than 25% above its reference price of $132.[55]On 3 July 2020, cybersecurity firm vpnMentor discovered a database containing 380 million individual records, including the logins and passwords of Spotify users.[56] The database was thought to be evidence of an impending credential stuffing cyberattack targeting Spotify[57] as it contained the credentials of up to 350,000 compromised user accounts.[58] In response to the attack, Spotify issued a rolling reset of passwords for affected accounts in November 2020.[59]In May 2013, Spotify acquired music discovery app Tunigo.[60] In March 2014, they acquired The Echo Nest, a music intelligence company.[61][62] In June 2015, Spotify announced they had acquired Seed Scientific, a data science consulting firm and analytics company. In a comment to TechCrunch, Spotify said that Seed Scientific's team would lead an Advanced Analytics unit within the company focused on developing data services.[63][64] In January 2016, they acquired social and messaging startups Cord Project and Soundwave,[65] followed in April 2016 by CrowdAlbum, a \"startup that collects photos and videos of performances shared on social networks,\" and would \"enhance the development of products that help artists understand, activate, and monetize their audiences\".[66] In November 2016, Spotify acquired Preact, a \"cloud-based platform and service developed for companies that operate on subscription models which helps reduce churn and build up their subscriber numbers\".[67]In March 2017, Spotify acquired Sonalytic, an audio detection startup, for an undisclosed amount of money. Spotify stated that Sonalytic would be used to improve the company's personalised playlists, better match songs with compositions, and improve the company's publishing data system.[68] Spotify also acquired MightyTV later in March, an app connected to television streaming services, including Netflix and HBO Go, that recommends content to users. Spotify mainly uses MightyTV to improve its advertising efforts on the free tier of service.[69] In April, they acquired Mediachain, a blockchain startup that had been developing a decentralized database system for managing attribution, and other metadata for media.[70][71] This was followed May with the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Niland, which uses technology to improve personalisation and recommendation features for users.[72][73] In November, Spotify acquired Soundtrap, an online music studio startup.[74][75]On 12 April 2018, Spotify acquired the music licensing platform Loudr.[76] On 6 February 2019, Spotify acquired the podcast networks Gimlet Media and Anchor FM Inc., with the goal of establishing themselves as a leading figure in podcasting.[77][78][79] On 26 March, Spotify announced they would acquire another podcast network, Parcast.[80][81] On 12 September, Spotify acquired SoundBetter, a music production marketplace for people in the music industry to collaborate on projects, and distribute music tracks for licensing.[82]On 5 February 2020, Spotify announced its intent to acquire Bill Simmons' sports and pop culture blog and podcast network The Ringer for an undisclosed amount.[83][84]  On 19 May 2020, Spotify acquired exclusive rights to stream the popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience beginning in September of that year, under an agreement valued at around US$100 million.[85][86]In November 2020, Spotify announced plans to acquire Megaphone from The Slate Group for US$235 million.[87] In March 2021, Spotify acquired app developer Betty Labs and their live social audio app, Locker Room,[88] Locker Room was rebranded in June 2021 as Spotify Greenroom, and turned into a Clubhouse competitor.[89] Also in June, Spotify acquired Podz, a podcast discovery startup.[90] In November, Spotify acquired audiobook company Findaway, including its publishing imprint OrangeSky Audio.[91]In February 2022, Spotify acquired Chartable and Podsights. Both are podcast ad companies.[92] In 2022, Spotify Greenroom rebranded as Spotify Live.[93]In January 2015, Sony announced PlayStation Music, a new music service with Spotify as its exclusive partner. PlayStation Music incorporates the Spotify service into Sony's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 gaming consoles, and Sony Xperia mobile devices. The service launched on 30 March 2015.[94] In March 2017, Spotify announced a partnership with the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference for 2017, presenting specific content in special playlists through an SXSW hub in Spotify's apps. The integration also enabled Spotify within the SXSW GO app to help users discover and explore artists performing at the conference. Two more partnerships were announced in March; one with WNYC Studios, and one with Waze. The WNYC Studios partnership brought various podcasts from WNYC to Spotify, including Note To Self, On the Media and Here's the Thing. Spotify also announced that the third season of WNYC Studios' 2 Dope Queens podcast would premiere with a two-week exclusivity period on the service on 21 March 2017.[95] The Waze partnership allows Waze app users to view directions to destinations within the Spotify app and access their Spotify playlists through the Waze app.[96]In October, Microsoft announced that it would be ending its Groove Music streaming service by December, with all music from users transferring to Spotify as part of a new partnership.[97] In December, Spotify and Tencent's music arm, Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), agreed to swap stakes and make an investment in each other's music businesses.[98][99] As a result of this transaction, Spotify gained a 9% stake in TME with TME gaining a 7.5% stake in Spotify.[100]In February 2018, Spotify integrated with the gaming-oriented voice chat service Discord on desktop clients, allowing users to display their currently-playing song as a rich presence on their profile, and invite other users with Spotify Premium to group \"listening parties\".[101] In April, Spotify announced a discounted entertainment bundle with video-on-demand provider Hulu, which included discounted rates for university students.[102]In May 2020, Spotify teamed up with ESPN and Netflix to curate podcasts around their Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance,[103] and in September, Spotify signed a deal with Chernin Entertainment to produce movies and TV shows.[104]In 2022, Spotify became the official streaming partner of FC Barcelona.[105]In May 2022, Spotify announced a partnership with the online game platform and game creation system the Roblox Corporation, the partnership saw Spotify as the first streaming brand to have a presence within the game with the launch of \u201cSpotify island\u201d.[106]In July 2015, Spotify launched an email campaign to urge its App Store subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and start new ones through its website, bypassing the 30% transaction fee for in-app purchases required for iOS applications by technology company Apple Inc.[107] A later update to the Spotify app on iOS was rejected by Apple, prompting Spotify's general counsel Horacio Gutierrez to write a letter to Apple's then-general counsel Bruce Sewell, stating: \"This latest episode raises serious concerns under both U.S. and EU competition law. It continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music, particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple's previous anticompetitive conduct aimed at Spotify \u2026 we cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors.\"[108]Sewell responded to the letter: \"We find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers and are publicly resorting to rumors and half-truths about our service.\" He also elaborated that \"Our guidelines apply equally to all app developers, whether they are game developers, e-book sellers, video-streaming services or digital music distributors; and regardless of whether or not they compete against Apple. We did not alter our behavior or our rules when we introduced our own music streaming service or when Spotify became a competitor\". Furthermore, he stated that \"There is nothing in Apple's conduct that 'amounts to a violation of applicable antitrust laws.' Far from it. ... I would be happy to facilitate an expeditious review and approval of your app as soon as you provide us with something that is compliant with the App Store's rules\".[109][110]In the following months, Spotify joined several other companies in filing a letter with the European Union's antitrust body indirectly accusing Apple and Google of \"abusing their 'privileged position' at the top of the market\", by referring to \"some\" companies as having \"transformed into 'gatekeepers' rather than 'gateways'\".[111][112] The complaint led to the European Union announcing that it would prepare an initiative by the end of 2017 for a possible law addressing unfair competition practices.[113][114]Spotify released the first version of its Apple Watch app in November 2018, allowing playback control of the iPhone via the watch. Users can also choose which devices to play music on via Bluetooth.[115] In a further escalation of the dispute with Apple, on 13 March 2019, Spotify filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission over unfair app store practices. Two days later, Apple responded, stating that the claim was misleading rhetoric and that Spotify wanted benefits of a free app without being a free app. Spotify responded with a statement calling Apple a monopolist and stated that they had only filed the complaint as Apple's actions hurt competition and consumers and clearly violated the law. It also said that Apple believed Spotify users on the app store were Apple's customers and not Spotify's.[116]Apple responded to Spotify's claims by counter-claiming that Spotify's market reach and user base would not have been possible without the Apple App Store platform. Additionally, Apple stated that they have attempted to work with Spotify to integrate the service better with Apple's products, such as Siri and Apple Watch.[117] In 2019, under iOS 13, it became possible to play Spotify music using Siri commands.[118]Spotify was one of the first companies to support Epic Games in their lawsuit against Apple, which was filed after Epic also tried to bypass Apple's 30% fee for microtransactions in Fortnite. In September 2020, Spotify, Epic, and other companies founded The Coalition for App Fairness, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in app stores.[119]On March 1 2021, Spotify confirmed that its platform would no longer have access to music from artists represented by Kakao Entertainment. After talking it out and renewing the contracts between the two. Spotify later announced that they had reached an agreement with Kakao Entertainment, allowing their content to be available once again on the platform across the globe.[120]In November 2021, Spotify hid the \"shuffle\" button for albums following a request by singer Adele, arguing that tracks in albums are supposed to be played back in the order specified by the artist in order to \"tell a story\".[121]Spotify operates under a freemium business model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify generates revenue by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties. Some of the premium options users may choose from include individual, duo, family, and student.[122]In December 2013, the company launched a new website, \"Spotify for Artists, \" explaining its business model and revenue data. Spotify gets its content from major record labels as well as independent artists and pays copyright holders royalties for streaming music. The company pays 70% of its total revenue to rights holders. Spotify for Artists states that the company does not have a fixed per-play rate; instead, it considers factors such as the user's home country and the individual artist's royalty rate. Rightsholders received an average per-play payout between $.000029 and $.0084.[123]Spotify offers an unlimited subscription package, close to the Open Music Model (OMM) estimated economic equilibrium for the recording industry.[citation needed] However, the incorporation of digital rights management (DRM) limitation[124] diverges from the OMM and competitors such as iTunes Store and Amazon Music that have dropped DRM.[125][126]In 2013, Spotify revealed that it paid artists an average of $0.007 per stream. Music Week editor Tim Ingham commented that the figure was not as \"alarming\" as it appeared, writing: \"Unlike buying a CD or download, streaming is not a one-off payment. Hundreds of millions of streams of tracks are happening every day, which quickly multiplies the potential revenues on offer \u2013 and is a constant long-term source of income for artists.\"[127]As of November 2018, the two Spotify subscription types, all offering unlimited listening time, are:In March 2014, Spotify introduced a new, discounted Premium subscription tier for students. Students in the United States enrolled in a university can pay half-price for a Premium subscription.[129] In April 2017, the Students offer was expanded to 33 more countries.[130][131]Spotify introduced its Family subscription in October 2014, connecting up to five family members for a shared Premium subscription.[132][133] Spotify Family was upgraded in May 2016, letting up to six people share a subscription and reducing the price.[134] The Family subscription provides access to Spotify Kids.[135]In November 2018, Spotify announced it was opening up Spotify Connect to all of the users using its Free service, however, these changes still required products supporting Spotify Connect to support the latest software development kit.[136][137]In February 2021, Spotify announced their plans to introduce a HiFi subscription, to offer listening in high fidelity, lossless sound quality. The rollout for the HiFi tier is yet to be announced.[128]In August 2021, Spotify launched a test subscription tier called Spotify Plus. The subscription costs $0.99 and is supposed to be a combination of the free and premium tiers. Subscribers to this plan will still receive ads but will get the ability to listen to songs without shuffle mode and skip any number of tracks. The company reported that the tier conditions may change before its full launch.[138]In 2008, just after launch, the company made a loss of 31.8 million Swedish kronor (US$4.4 million).[139] In October 2010, Wired reported that Spotify was making more money for labels in Sweden than any other retailer \"online or off\".[140] Years after growth and expansion, a November 2012 report suggested strong momentum for the company. In 2011, it reported a near US$60 million net loss from revenue of $244 million, while it was expected to generate a net loss of $40 million from revenue of $500 million in 2012.[141] Another source of income was music purchases from within the app, however this service was removed in January 2013.[142]In May 2016, Spotify announced \"Sponsored Playlists\", a monetisation opportunity in which brands can specify the audiences they have in mind, with Spotify matching the marketer with suitable music in a playlist.[143][144] That September, Spotify announced that it had paid a total of over $5 billion to the music industry.[145] In June 2017, as part of renegotiated licenses with Universal Music Group and Merlin Network, Spotify's financial filings revealed its agreement to pay more than $2 billion in minimum payments over the next two years.[146][147]As of 2017[update], Spotify was not yet a profitable company.[148] Spotify's revenue for Q1 2020 amounted to \u20ac1.85 billion ($2 billion). A large part of this sum, \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.84 billion), came from Spotify Premium subscribers. Gross profit in the same quarter amounted to \u20ac472 million ($511 million), with an operating loss of \u20ac17 million ($18 million).[149] Despite subscriber and podcasts growth, during Q2 of 2020, Spotify reported a loss of \u20ac356 million (\u20ac1.91 per share). The \"deeper\" loss came as a result of the company's tax debt to over one-third of its employees in Sweden.[150]In February 2010, Spotify received a small investment from Founders Fund, where board member Sean Parker was recruited to assist Spotify in \"winning the labels over in the world's largest music market\".[151] In June 2011, Spotify secured $100 million of funding and planned to use this to support its US launch. The new round of funding valued the company at $1 billion.[152] A Goldman Sachs-led round of funding closed in November 2012, raising around $100 million at a $3 billion valuation.[153]In April 2015, Spotify began another round of fundraising, with a report from The Wall Street Journal stating it was seeking $400 million, which would value the company at $8.4 billion.[154] The financing was closed in June 2015, with Spotify raising $526 million, at a value of $8.53 billion.[155] In January 2016, Spotify raised another $500 million through convertible bonds.[156]In March 2016, Spotify raised $1 billion in financing by debt plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place.[157] The company was, according to TechCrunch, planning to launch on the stock market in 2017, but in 2017 it was seen as planning on doing the IPO in 2018 in order to \"build up a better balance sheet and work on shifting its business model to improve its margins\".[158]In March 2009, Spotify began offering music downloads in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Users could purchase tracks from Spotify, which partnered with 7digital to incorporate the feature. The ability to purchase and download music tracks via the app was removed on 4 January 2013.[142]In November 2015, Spotify introduced a \"Fan Insights\" panel in limited beta form, letting artists and managers access data on monthly listeners, geographical data, demographic information, music preferences and more.[159] In April 2017, the panel was upgraded to leave beta status, renamed as \"Spotify for Artists\", and opened to all artists and managers. Additional features include the ability to get \"verified\" status with a blue checkmark on an artist's profile, receiving artist support from Spotify, customising the profile page with photos and promoting a certain song as their \"pick\".[160][161]In September 2018, Spotify announced \"Upload Beta,\" allowing artists to upload directly to the platform instead of going through a distributor or record label.[162] The feature was rolled out to a small number of US-based artists by invitation only. Uploading was free and artists received 100% of the revenue from songs they uploaded; artists were able to control when their release went public. On 1 July 2019, Spotify deprecated the program and announced plans to stop accepting direct uploads by the end of that month and eventually remove all content uploaded in this manner.[163]In June 2017, Variety reported that Spotify would announce \"Secret Genius,\" a new initiative aimed at highlighting songwriters and producers, and the effect those people have on the music industry and the artists' careers. The project, which would feature awards, \"Songshops\" songwriting workshops, curated playlists, and podcasts, is an effort to \"shine a light on these people behind the scenes who play such a big role in some of the most important moments of our lives. When the general public hears a song, they automatically associate it with the artist who sings it, not the people behind the scenes who make it happen, so we thought the title Secret Genius was appropriate\", Spotify'sformer Global Head of Creator Services Troy Carter told Variety the first awards ceremony would take place in late 2017,[needs update] and was intended to honour \"the top songwriters, producers and publishers in the industry as well as up-and-coming talent.\" Additionally, as part of \"The Ambassador Program,\" 13 songwriters would each host a Songshop workshop, in which their peers would collaboratively attempt to create a hit song, with the first workshop taking place in Los Angeles in June 2017.[164]In October 2017, Spotify launched \"Rise\", a program aimed at promoting emerging artists.[165][166] In February 2020, Spotify announced it would be featuring new songwriter pages and 'written by' playlists. This was aimed at giving fans a behind the scenes look at the process of some of their favorite songwriters. Initial pages added included Justin Trantor, Meghan Trainor, and Missy Elliott. Spotify thereafter announced it was planning to add more of these pages and playlists to highlight songwriters.[167][168]In January 2021, Spotify made a selection of audiobooks available on the platform as a test of developing a greater breadth of content for users.[169] The addition of audiobooks to the service would create similar offerings to that of Amazon's Audible. In 2020, Spotify partnered with Wizarding World to release a series of recorded readings of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, by various stars of the franchise.[170]On 31 January 2018, Spotify started testing a new Pandora-styled standalone app called Stations by Spotify for Australian Android users.[171] It features 62 music channels, each devoted to a particular genre. Spotify itself has two channels named after its playlists that link directly to the users' profile: \"Release Radar\" and \"Discover Weekly.\" The aim is to help users to listen to the music they want without information overload or spending time building their own playlists. At launch, the skipping feature was not featured to \"reinforce the feel of radio,\" but it was quietly added later and with no limits. Songs can be \"loved\" but can't be \"hated.\" If a song is \"loved,\" a custom radio channel will be created based on it, and when there are at least 15 of these songs, a \"My Favourites\" channel is unlocked.The standalone app has been made available to all iOS and Android users in the United States since 4 June 2019.[172]Spotify announced the app would be shut down on 16 May 2022. The company said users would be able to login into the main Spotify app with their Stations account and transfer their stations into Spotify.[173]Spotify has client software currently available for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S game consoles. Spotify also offers an official, although unsupported (developed as a \"labour of love\" by Spotify engineers; support is offered through the Spotify Community), version of Spotify for Linux clients. Spotify also offers a proprietary protocol known as \"Spotify Connect\", which lets users listen to music through a wide range of entertainment systems, including speakers, receivers, TVs, cars, and smartwatches. Spotify also has a web player (open.spotify.com).[181] Unlike the apps, the web player does not have the ability to download music for offline listening. In June 2017, Spotify became available as an app through Windows Store.[182][183]In Spotify's apps, music can be browsed or searched for via various parameters, such as artist, album, genre, playlist, or record label. Users can create, edit and share playlists, share tracks on social media, and make playlists with other users. Spotify provides access to over 70 million songs, 2.2 million podcasts and 4 billion playlists.[184][185][8]In November 2011, Spotify introduced a Spotify Apps service that made it possible for third-party developers to design applications that could be hosted within the Spotify computer software. The applications provided features such as synchronised lyrics, music reviews, and song recommendations.[186] In June 2012, Soundrop became the first Spotify app to attract major funding, receiving $3 million from Spotify investor Northzone.[187][188] However, after the June 2014 announcement of a Web API that allowed third-party developers to integrate Spotify content in their own web applications, the company discontinued its Spotify Apps platform in October, stating that its new development tools for the Spotify web player fulfilled many of the advantages of the former Spotify Apps service, but \"would ensure the Spotify platform remained relevant and easy to develop on, as well as enabling you to build innovative and engaging music experiences\".[189]In April 2012, Spotify introduced a \"Spotify Play Button\", an embeddable music player that can be added to blogs, websites, or social media profiles, that lets visitors listen to a specific song, playlist, or album without leaving the page.[190] The following November, the company began rolling out a web player, with a similar design to its computer programs, but without the requirement of any installation.[181]In December 2012, Spotify introduced a \"Follow\" tab and a \"Discover\" tab, along with a \"Collection\" section. \"Follow\" lets users follow artists and friends to see what they are listening to, while \"Discover\" directs users to new releases as well as music, review, and concert recommendations based on listening history. Users can add tracks to a \"Collection\" section of the app, rather than adding them to a specific playlist.[191][192] The features were announced by CEO Daniel Ek at a press conference, with Ek saying that a common user complaint about the service was that \"Spotify is great when you know what music you want to listen to, but not when you don't\".[193]In May 2015, Spotify announced a new \"Home\" start-page that could recommend music. The company also introduced \"Spotify Running\", a feature aimed at improving music while running with music matched to running tempo, and announced that podcasts and videos (\"entertainment, news and clips\") would be coming to Spotify, along with \"Spotify Originals\" content.[194][195][196]In December 2015, Spotify debuted Spotify Wrapped, a program that creates playlists based on each user's most listened-to songs from the year. Users then can view and save this playlist at the end of the year.   While it continued to provide users with an end-of-the-year wrap up, the playlist feature was later removed.[197][198]In January 2016, Spotify and music annotation service Genius formed a partnership, bringing annotation information from Genius into infocards presented while songs are playing in Spotify. The functionality is limited to selected playlists and was only available on Spotify's iOS app at launch,[199][200][201] being expanded to the Android app in April 2017. This feature was known as \"Behind the Lyrics\".[202][203] As of November 18, 2021, \"Behind the Lyrics\" has been replaced with auto-generated real-time lyrics due to consumer demand. The feature is powered by lyrics provider Musixmatch.[204]In May 2017, Spotify introduced Spotify Codes for its mobile apps, a way for users to share specific artists, tracks, playlists or albums with other people. Users find the relevant content to share and press a \"soundwave-style barcode\" on the display. A camera icon in the apps' search fields lets other users point their device's camera at the code, which takes them to the same content.[205][206][207]In January 2019, Spotify introduced Car View for Android, allowing devices running Android to have a compact Now Playing screen when the device is connected to a car's Bluetooth.[208][209] Also in January 2019, Spotify beta-tested its Canvas feature, where artists and/or labels can upload looping 3 to 8-second moving visuals to their tracks, replacing album covers in the \"Now Playing\" view; users have the option to turn off this feature. Canvas is only available for Spotify's iOS and Android mobile apps.[210] Months later, Spotify tested its own version of stories (the sharing format popularized by social apps) known as \"Storyline\", and the focus is on allowing artists to share their own insights, inspiration, details about their creative process or other meanings behind the music.[211]In March 2021, Spotify announced an upcoming option for higher-resolution sound, Spotify Hi-Fi.[212]In July 2015, Spotify launched Discover Weekly, a playlist generated weekly.  Updated on Mondays, it provides users with music recommendations.[213][214] In December 2015, Quartz reported that songs in Discover Weekly playlists had been streamed 1.7 billion times,.[215]In March 2016 Spotify launched six playlists branded as Fresh Finds, including the main playlist and Fire Emoji, Basement, Hiptronix, Six Strings, and Cyclone (hip-hop, electronic, pop, guitar-driven, and experimental music respectively). The playlists spotlight songs by lesser-known musicians and their songs.[216]In August 2016, Spotify launched Release Radar, a personalised playlist that allows users to stay up-to-date on new music released by the artists they listen to the most. It also helps users discover new music, by mixing in other artists' music. The playlist is updated every Friday, and is a maximum of two hours in length.[217][218]The RADAR program is Spotify's global artist program, exclusively designed to help emerging artists worldwide reach the next stage in their careers and strengthen their connection to listeners.[citation needed]Spotify provides artists taking part in RADAR with resources and access to integrated marketing opportunities to help them boost their careers, in addition to expanded reach and exposure to 178 markets worldwide.[219]In September 2016, Spotify introduced Daily Mix, a series of (up to six) playlists that mixes the user's favourite tracks with new, recommended songs. New users can access Daily Mix after approximately two weeks of listening to music through Spotify. Daily Mixes were only available on the Android and iOS mobile apps at launch, but the feature was later expanded to Spotify's computer app in December 2016.[citation needed]In 2017, Spotify introduced RapCaviar, a hip-hop playlist.[220][221] Rap Caviar had 10.9 million followers by 2019, becoming one of Spotify's Top 5 playlists.[222] RapCaviar was originally curated by Tuma Basa.[223] It was  relaunched by Carl Chery in 2019.[224]In July 2018, Spotify introduced a beta feature that gives artists, labels, and teams an easy way to submit unreleased music directly to Spotify's editorial team for playlist consideration.[citation needed]In June 2019, Spotify launched a custom playlist titled \"Your Daily Drive\" that closely replicates the drive time format of many traditional radio stations. It combines short-form podcast news updates from The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and PRI with a mix of a user's favorite songs and artists interspersed with tracks the listener has yet to discover. \"Your Daily Drive,\" which is found in a user's library under the \"Made For You\" section, updates throughout the day.[225]In May 2020, Spotify introduced the Group Session feature. This feature allows two or more Premium users in the same location to share control over the music that's being played.[226] The Group Session feature was later expanded to allow any Premium user to join/participate in a Group Session, with a special link the host can send to participants.[227]In July 2021, Spotify launched the \"What's New\" feed, a section that collects all new releases and episodes from artists and podcasts that the user follows. The feature is represented by a bell icon on the app's main page and is available on iOS and Android.[228]In November 2021, Spotify launched the City and Local Pulse charts, aimed at representing the songs listened to in major cities around the world. The charts are available for 200 cities with the most listeners on Spotify.[229]Spotify has experimented with different limitations to users' listening on the Free service tier.In April 2011, Spotify announced via a blog post that they would drastically cut the amount of music that free members could access, effective 1 May 2011. The post stated that all free members would be limited to ten hours of music streaming per month, and in addition, individual tracks were limited to five plays. New users were exempt from these changes for six months.[230] In March 2013, the five-play individual track limit was removed for users in the United Kingdom, and media reports stated that users in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand never had the limit in the first place.[231][232]In December 2013, CEO Daniel Ek announced that Android and iOS smartphone users with the free service tier could listen to music in Shuffle mode, a feature in which users can stream music by specific artists and playlists without being able to pick which songs to hear. Mobile listening previously was not allowed in Spotify Free accounts. Ek stated that \"We're giving people the best free music experience in the history of the smartphone.\"[233][234] This shuffle feature is not available on Android and iOS tablets, or computers.In January 2014, Spotify removed all time limits for Free users on all platforms, including on computers, which previously had a 10-hour monthly listening limit after a 6-month grace period.[235][236]In April 2018, Spotify began to allow Free users to listen on-demand to whatever songs they want for an unlimited number of times, as long as the song is on one of the user's 15 personalized discovery playlists.[237]Before April 2020, all service users were limited to 10,000 songs in their library, after which they would receive an \"Epic collection, friend\" notification and would not be able to save more music to their library. Adding playlists at this point also arbitrarily removed older playlists from the users' library. Spotify later removed this limit.Spotify is proprietary and uses digital rights management (DRM) controls.[124] Spotify's terms and conditions do not permit users to reverse-engineer the application.Spotify allows users to add local audio files for music not in its catalog into the user's library through Spotify's desktop application, and then allows users to synchronize those music files to Spotify's mobile apps or other computers over the same Wi-Fi network as the primary computer by creating a Spotify playlist, and adding those local audio files to the playlist. Audio files must either be in the .mp3, .mp4 (.mp4 files that have video streams are not supported), or .m4p media formats. This feature is available only for Premium subscribers.Spotify has a median playback latency of 265 ms (including local cache).[238]In April 2014, Spotify moved away from the peer-to-peer (P2P) system they had used to distribute music to users. Previously, a desktop user would listen to music from one of three sources: a cached file on the computer, one of Spotify's servers, or from other subscribers through the P2P system. P2P, a well-established Internet distribution system, served as an alternative that reduced Spotify's server resources and costs. However, Spotify ended the P2P setup in 2014, with Spotify's Alison Bonny telling TorrentFreak: \"We're gradually phasing out the use of our desktop P2P technology which has helped our users enjoy their music both speedily and seamlessly. We're now at a stage where we can power music delivery through our growing number of servers and ensure our users continue to receive a best-in-class service.\"[239]Spotify first announced a voice-activated music-streaming gadget for cars in May 2019. Named the Car Thing, it represents the music-streaming service's first entry into hardware devices.[240] In early 2020, as part of filings to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), submitted images of the device that make it seem much more like a miniature infotainment screen.[241] In April 2021, Spotify rolled out its own voice assistant with the hands-free wake word: \"Hey Spotify\".[242] Using this, users can perform various actions such as pulling playlists, launching radio stations, playing or pausing songs. This voice-based virtual assistant may be intended more towards Spotify's own hardware such as its \"Car Thing\".[243][244] The company is incorporated in Luxembourg as Spotify Technology S.A,[245] and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, with offices in 16 countries around the world.[246][247] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Spotify closed its office in Russia[248] and suspended both premium and free services from the country until further notice.[249] However, the support service continues to work for Russian users.[citation needed]In September 2010, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced the company as a Technology Pioneer for 2011.[276][277]Spotify has attracted significant criticism since its 2006 launch.[278] The primary point of criticism centres around what artists, music creators, and the media have described as \"unsustainable\" compensation.[279] Unlike physical sales or legal downloads (both of which were the main medium of listening to music at the time), which pay artists a fixed amount per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on their \"market share\": the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service. Spotify distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights-holders, who will then pay artists based on their individual agreements.[123] Worldwide, 30,000 musicians have joined the organization UnionOfMusicians (UMAW).[280] UMAW organized protests in 31 cities in March 2021 and its campaign #JusticeAtSpotify is demanding more transparency and a compensation of one cent per stream.[280]Spotify has been criticised by artists and producers including Thom Yorke and Taylor Swift, who have argued that Spotify does not fairly compensate musicians, and both withdrew their music from the service.[281][282] Their catalogues returned to the service in 2017.[283][284] While the streaming music industry in general faces the same critique about inadequate payments,[285] Spotify, being the leading service,[286] faces particular scrutiny due to its free service tier, allowing users to listen to music for free, though with advertisements between tracks. The free service tier has led to a variety of major album releases being delayed or withdrawn from the service.[287][288][289] In response to the allegations about unfair compensation, Spotify claims that it is benefitting the industry by migrating users away from unauthorized copying and less monetised platforms to its free service tier, and then downgrades that service until they upgrade to paid accounts.[123] A study has shown that record labels keep a high amount of the money earned from Spotify,[290][291] and the CEO of Merlin Network, a representative body for over 10,000 independent labels, has also observed significant yearly growth rates in earnings from Spotify, while clarifying that Spotify pays labels, not artists.[292] In 2017, as part of its efforts to renegotiate licence deals for an interest in going public, Spotify announced that artists would be able to make albums temporarily exclusive to paid subscribers if the albums are part of Universal Music Group or the Merlin Network.In May 2018, Spotify attracted criticism for its \"Hate Content & Hateful Conduct policy\" that removed the music of R. Kelly and XXXTentacion from its editorial and algorithmic playlists because \"When we look at promotion, we look at issues around hateful conduct, where you have an artist or another creator who has done something off-platform that is so particularly out of line with our values, egregious, in a way that it becomes something that we don't want to associate ourselves with.\" R. Kelly has faced accusations of sexual abuse, while XXXTentacion was on trial for domestic abuse in a case that did not reach a judgement before his death that June.[293] This policy was revoked in June because the company deemed the original wording to be too \"vague\"; they stated that \"Across all genres, our role is not to regulate artists. Therefore, we are moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct\".[294] However, artists such as Gary Glitter and Lostprophets are still hidden from Spotify's radio stations.[295]According to some computer science and music experts, various music communities are often ignored or overlooked by music streaming services, such as Spotify.[296][297][298][299] The most commonly perceived error is said to be caused by a lack of diverse scope within curation staff, including overlooking mainstay artists in large genres, potentially causing a categorical homogenization of musical styles; even impacting mainline artists like within hip hop with A Tribe Called Quest.[297] This can potentially have a negative impact on heritage styles, amongst both popular and traditional genres of New Mexico music and folk music, and possibly hindering the growth of styles such as country rap and contemporary Christian music.[298]In 2016, Spotify was criticized for allegedly making certain artists' music harder to find than others as these artists would release their music to the rival streaming service Apple Music before releasing it to Spotify.[300]In March 2021, David Dayen argued in The American Prospect [301] that musicians were in peril due to monopolies in streaming services like Spotify. Daniel Ek, co-founder and CEO of Spotify, discussed \"what he called an artist-friendly streaming solution.\" He explained, \"An extension of the internet radio craze of the early 2000s, Spotify would license content from record labels, and then support artists as people listened to their music.\"[301] However, Dayen noted that such services draw revenue from advertisements, the promise of audience growth to investors, and data collection.[citation needed]In 2020, Spotify received criticism from anti-misinformation groups when conspiracy theorist Alex Jones appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.[302] Spotify's employees raised concerns about Jones' appearance on the show.[303] In 2021, Spotify removed 42 episodes of Rogan's podcast.[304]In January 2022, 270 scientists, physicians, professors, doctors, healthcare workers, veterinarians, a dentist, psychologists, physicians' assistants, medical students, an engineer and a podcast host wrote an open letter to Spotify expressing concern over \"false and societally harmful assertions\" on The Joe Rogan Experience and asked Spotify to \"establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform\". The 270 signatories objected to Rogan broadcasting COVID-19 misinformation, citing \"a highly controversial\" episode featuring guest Robert Malone (#1757). The episode has been criticized for \"promoting baseless conspiracy theories\", including \"an unfounded theory that societal leaders have 'hypnotized' the public.\" The signatories assert: \"Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.\" The signatories also note that Malone was suspended from Twitter for spreading misinformation about COVID-19.[305][306]On 26 January 2022, Neil Young removed his music from Spotify after they refused to remove the podcast.[307] Joni Mitchell subsequently removed her music in support of Young.[308][309] Other artists and podcasters, such as Nils Lofgren, Bren\u00e9 Brown and Crosby, Stills, & Nash, also announced a boycott of Spotify.[310][311][312] Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who signed a multi-year partnership with Spotify, said that since April 2021 they had been \"expressing concerns\" over COVID-19 misinformation on the platform.[313]Amid the controversy, as of 28 January 2022 Spotify's stock had fallen 12% week-on-week,[314] a loss of $4 billion in market capitalization.[315] By 30 January 2022, this number had grown to a loss of $6.7 billion in market value, a fall of 17% week-on-week, and a fall of 26% year-to-date.[316] Spotify's stock fell by 13% after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings on February 2, 2022. Although Ek addressed the Rogan controversy during the earnings call, the loss in value was attributed to the company's guidance on Q1 user growth, which did not meet analyst expectations.[317][318]Spotify promised to add content advisories for anything containing discussions related to COVID-19 and posted additional rules.[319] Rogan apologized for his role in the controversy, and defended his interviews with two controversial guests, Robert W. Malone and Peter A. McCullough, as \"highly credentialed, very intelligent, very accomplished people, and they have an opinion that is different from the mainstream narrative\". Rogan said he agreed with Spotify's plan to label episodes including COVID-19 discussions and would try to \"have more experts with differing opinions, right after the controversial ones\".[320]In February 2022, Spotify removed about 70 more episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience, reportedly at Rogan's own request.[321][322] Musician India Arie shared a compilation of clips in which Rogan used the \"n word\" on the podcast, and a clip in which Rogan appears to liken being around black people with the film Planet of the Apes. Arie announced that she was also boycotting Spotify. Rogan posted an apology, saying it was \"regretful and shameful\", but said that the clips were \"taken out of context\".[323]  In a message to employees, Ek said:  \"While I strongly condemn what Joe has said and I agree with his decision to remove past episodes from our platform, I realize some will want more. And I want to make one point very clear \u2014 I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer.\"[324]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Billboard_Hot_100": "The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs, published weekly by Billboard magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming in the United States.[1]The weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is also tracked on a Friday to Thursday cycle effective with the chart dated July 17, 2021[2] (previously Monday to Sunday and before July 2015, Wednesday to Tuesday[3]). A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesdays but post-dated to the following Saturday.The first number one song of the Billboard Hot 100 was \"Poor Little Fool\" by Ricky Nelson, on August 4, 1958.[4] As of the issue for the week ending on May 7, 2022, the Billboard Hot 100 has had 1,136 different number one entries. The chart's current number-one song is \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles.[5]Before 1955, Billboard's lead popularity chart was the Honor Roll of Hits, established in 1945. This chart ranked the most popular songs regardless of performer based on record and sheet sales, disk jockey, and jukebox performances as determined by Billboard's weekly nationwide survey. [6] At the start of the rock era in 1955, there were three charts that measured songs by individual metrics:[7]Although officially all three charts had equal \"weight\" in terms of their importance, Billboard retrospectively considers the Best Sellers in Stores chart when referencing a song's performance before the creation of the Hot 100.[8] On the week ending November 12, 1955, Billboard published The Top 100 for the first time. The Top 100 combined all aspects of a single's performance (sales, airplay and jukebox activity), based on a point system that typically gave sales (purchases) more weight than radio airplay. The Best Sellers in Stores, Most Played by Jockeys and Most Played in Jukeboxes charts continued to be published concurrently with the new Top 100 chart.On June 17, 1957, Billboard discontinued the Most Played in Jukeboxes chart, as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rock-oriented music into their playlists. The week ending July 28, 1958 was the final publication of the Most Played by Jockeys and Top 100 charts, both of which had Perez Prado's instrumental version of \"Patricia\" ascending to the top.[citation needed]On August 4, 1958, Billboard premiered one main all-genre singles chart: the Hot 100. The Hot 100 quickly became the industry standard and Billboard discontinued the Best Sellers In Stores chart on October 13, 1958.The Billboard Hot 100 is still the standard by which a song's popularity is measured in the United States. The Hot 100 is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by Nielsen BDS, sales data compiled by Nielsen Soundscan (both at retail and digitally) and streaming activity provided by online music sources.[7]There are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the Hot 100. The most significant ones are:The tracking week for sales, streaming and airplay begins on Friday and ends on Thursday (airplay used to have a tracking week from Monday to Sunday, but effective with the chart dated July 17, 2021, the week was adjusted to align with the other two metrics[2]). A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesday. Each chart is post-dated with the \"week-ending\" issue date four days after the charts are refreshed online (i.e., the following Saturday).[9] For example:The methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the chart's history.Although the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chart-watchers and greatly affected pop culture and produced countless bits of trivia, the main purpose of the Hot 100 is to aid those within the music industry: to reflect the popularity of the \"product\" (the singles, the albums, etc.) and to track the trends of the buying public. Billboard has (many times) changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular. A very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay. During the Hot 100's early history, singles were the leading way by which people bought music. At times, when singles sales were robust, more weight was given to a song's retail points than to its radio airplay.As the decades passed, the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales. Musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of full-length albums rather than singles, and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether (see Album Cuts, below). Eventually, a song's airplay points were weighted more so than its sales. Billboard has adjusted the sales/airplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs.Billboard has also changed its Hot 100 policy regarding \"two-sided singles\" several times. The pre-Hot 100 chart \"Best Sellers in Stores\" listed popular A- and-B-sides together, with the side that was played most often (based on its other charts) listed first. One of the most notable of these, but far from the only one, was Elvis Presley's \"Don't Be Cruel\" / \"Hound Dog\". During the Presley single's chart run, top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times. But on the concurrent \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" and the \"Top 100\", the two songs were listed separately, as was true of all songs. With the initiation of the Hot 100 in 1958, A- and-B-sides charted separately, as they had on the former Top 100.Starting with the Hot 100 chart for the week ending November 29, 1969, this rule was altered; if both sides received significant airplay, they were listed together. This started to become a moot point by 1972, as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the 1960s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles provided to radio.More complex issues began to arise as the typical A-and-B-side format of singles gave way to 12 inch singles and maxi-singles, many of which contained more than one B-side. Further problems arose when, in several cases, a B-side would eventually overtake the A-side in popularity, thus prompting record labels to release a new single, featuring the former B-side as the A-side, along with a \"new\" B-side.The inclusion of album cuts on the Hot 100 put the double-sided hit issues to rest permanently.As many Hot 100 chart policies have been modified over the years, one rule always remained constant: songs were not eligible to enter the Hot 100 unless they were available to purchase as a single. However, on December 5, 1998, the Hot 100 changed from being a \"singles\" chart to a \"songs\" chart.[10] During the 1990s, a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles. It was claimed by major record labels[citation needed] that singles were cannibalizing album sales, so they were slowly phased out. During this period, accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production of the retail single sold out.It was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the Hot 100, or charted well after their airplay had declined. During the period that they were not released as singles, the songs were not eligible to chart. Many of these songs dominated the Hot 100 Airplay chart for extended periods of time:As debate and conflicts occurred more and more often, Billboard finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders by including airplay-only singles (or \"album cuts\") in the Hot 100.[citation needed]Extended play (EP) releases were listed by Billboard on the Hot 100 and in pre-Hot 100 charts (Top 100) until the mid-to-late 1960s. With the growing popularity of albums, it was decided to move EPs (which typically contain four to six tracks) from the Hot 100 to the Billboard 200, where they are included to this day.Since February 12, 2005, the Billboard Hot 100 tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as iTunes, Musicmatch, and Rhapsody. Billboard initially started tracking downloads in 2003 with the Hot Digital Tracks chart. However, these downloads did not count towards the Hot 100 and that chart (as opposed to Hot Digital Songs) counted each version of a song separately (the chart still exists today along with Hot Digital Songs). This was the first major overhaul of the Hot 100's chart formula since December 1998.The change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably, with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps. In recent years, several songs have been able to achieve 80-to-90 position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores. Since 2006, the all-time record for the biggest single-week upward movement was broken nine times.In the issue dated August 11, 2007, Billboard began incorporating weekly data from streaming media and on-demand services into the Hot 100. The first two major companies to provide their statistics to Nielsen BDS on a weekly basis were AOL Music and Yahoo! Music.[11] On March 24, 2012, Billboard premiered its On-Demand Songs chart, and its data was incorporated into the equation that compiles the Hot 100.[12] This was expanded to a broader Streaming Songs chart in January 2013, which ranks web radio streams from services such as Spotify, as well as on-demand audio titles.[13] In February 2013, U.S. views for a song on YouTube were added to the Hot 100 formula. \"Harlem Shake\" was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made.[14]In July 2020, Billboard announced that they would no longer allow sales of physical/digital bundles to be reported as digital sales. This refers to songs being bought along with merchandise, either from an artists website or through another vendor. The magazine stated that this was a tactic generally used by certain artists to boost their chart positions. Instead, such physical releases are now only counted when they are shipped to the consumer, rendering the tactic \"ineffectual\".[15]A growing trend in the early first decade of the 21st century was to issue a song as a \"remix\" that was so drastically different in structure and lyrical content from its original version that it was essentially a whole new song. Under normal circumstances, airplay points from a song's album version, \"radio\" mix and/or dance music remix, etc. were all combined and factored into the song's performance on the Hot 100, as the structure, lyrics and melody remained intact. Criticisms began when songs were being completely re-recorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording. The first such example of this scenario is Jennifer Lopez' \"I'm Real\". Originally entering the Hot 100 in its album version, a \"remix\" was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper Ja Rule. This new version proved to be far more popular than\nthe album version and the track was propelled to number one.To address this issue, Billboard now separates airplay points from a song's original version and its remix, if the remix is determined to be a \"new song\". Since administering this new chart rule, several songs have charted twice, normally credited as \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\". The remix rule is still in place.Billboard, in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks, has (since 1991) removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart. Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently (as of 2015[update]), a song is permanently moved to \"recurrent status\" if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position number 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks.[16] Exceptions are made to re-releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success. These rare cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and ultimately determined by Billboard's chart managers and staff. Christmas songs have been a regular presence on the Hot 100 each December since the relaxation of recurrent rules, culminating in Mariah Carey's 1994 recording \"All I Want for Christmas is You\" reaching #1 on the chart in December 2019.[17]Billboard altered its tracking-week for sales, streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new Global Release Date, which now falls on Fridays in all major-market territories (United States product was formerly released on Tuesdays before June 2015). This modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated July 25, 2015.[3]Billboard's \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for Billboard to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.Before Nielsen SoundScan, year-end singles charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a song's performance on the Hot 100 (for example, a song would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position 99 and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.After Billboard began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales, streaming, and airplay points. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's most popular tracks, as the points accrued by one song during its week at number one in March might be less than those accrued by another song reaching number three in January. Songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years, but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak occurred in a single year.The Hot 100 served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show American Top 40. This relationship ended on November 30, 1991, as American Top 40 started using the airplay-only side of the Hot 100 (then called Top 40 Radio Monitor). The ongoing splintering of Top 40 radio in the early 1990s led stations to lean into specific formats, meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly Hot 100 chart.An artist or band's ability to have hits in the Hot 100 across multiple decades is recognized as a sign of longevity and being able to adapt to changing musical styles. Only five artists had a Hot 100 Top 40 hit in each of the four decades from the 1980s through the 2010s: Michael Jackson, Madonna, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, U2, and Kenny G.[18] Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number-one single in four different decades.[19]A new chart, the Pop 100, was created by Billboard in February 2005 to answer criticism that the Hot 100 at the time was too dominated by hip hop and R&B. It was discontinued in June 2009 due to the charts becoming increasingly similar.The Canadian Hot 100 was launched June 16, 2007. Like the Hot 100 chart, it uses sales and airplay tracking compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and BDS.[20]The Japan Hot 100 was launched in the issue dated May 31, 2008, using the same methodologies as the Hot 100 charts for the U.S. and Canada, using sales and airplay data from SoundScan Japan and radio tracking service Plantech.[21]The Vietnamese edition of Hot 100, Billboard Vietnam Hot 100, was launched on January 14, 2022.[22]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sour_(Olivia_Rodrigo_album)": "Sour (stylized in all caps) is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter and actress Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on May 21, 2021, via Geffen Records. The album was written by Rodrigo and her producer Dan Nigro. Originally planned as an EP, Rodrigo expanded Sour into a full-length album following the viral success of her debut single, \"Drivers License\".Influenced by Rodrigo's favorite genres and singer-songwriters, Sour is primarily a pop record that spans from energetic pop punk songs to bedroom pop ballads. Its subject matter centers on adolescence, failed romance, and heartache. She said the album explores her perils and discoveries as a 17-year-old, with its title referring to the \"sour\" emotions young people experience but are often criticized for, such as anger, jealousy, and unhappiness.Three singles preceded Sour's release, all of which entered the top three of the US Billboard Hot 100. The lead single, \"Drivers License\", topped the chart and propelled Rodrigo to mainstream prominence. It was followed by \"Deja Vu\", which peaked at number 3, and \"Good 4 U\", the album's second chart-topper. It made Rodrigo the first artist in history to debut their first three singles in the top 10 of the Hot 100, and Sour the first debut album in history to spawn two number-one debuts on the chart. The album broke the global Spotify record for the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist. It topped the charts in several countries, including the US Billboard 200. \"Traitor\", prior to becoming the fourth single, landed at number nine on the Hot 100 as the fourth top-10 song from the album. Sour was one of the best-selling albums of 2021.Sour received widespread acclaim upon release, with it being regarded as a solid debut album, underscoring Rodrigo's realistic lyrics and appeal to Generation Z. Various publications listed it among the best albums of 2021, including Billboard and Rolling Stone that placed the album at number one on their year-end rankings. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Sour and \"Drivers License\" won Best Pop Vocal Album and Pop Solo Performance, respectively; Rodrigo won Best New Artist as well. A YouTube concert film and a Disney+ documentary, titled Sour Prom and Driving Home 2 U respectively, supplement the album. Rodrigo embarked on the Sour Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on April 5, 2022.In 2020, American actress and singer Olivia Rodrigo signed to Geffen Records, intending to release her debut EP the following year.[4] American songwriter and producer Daniel Nigro was suggested by a friend to listen to Rodrigo's songs on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Soundtrack (2020). Nigro was \"just completely blown away\" and reached out to Rodrigo via Instagram, offering to work with her. The pair had a meeting to get to know one another, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the United States. They started collaborating after figuring out ways to work safely in isolation.[5][6] She released her debut single \"Drivers License\", produced by Nigro, on January 8, 2021, to unprecedented commercial and critical success. Billboard declared the single one of the most dominant number-one songs in Hot 100 history.[7]Rodrigo began teasing a follow-up single by archiving her past Instagram posts and posting cryptic teasers of it on her social media accounts in late March 2021;[8] on March 29, she announced that it would be titled \"Deja Vu\", and set a release date of three days later, reassuring fans that the announcement was not an April Fools' Day joke. Rodrigo unveiled the song's artwork in the same post.[9][10] Following her rise to prominence, Rodrigo stated that she would be releasing a studio album instead of an EP,[11] after she felt unsatisfied with the scope of a shorter project when only a full-length album would be \"truly reflective of what [she] can do\".[12]I want [Sour] to be super versatile. My dream is to have it be an intersection between mainstream pop, folk music, and alternative pop. I love the songwriting and the lyricism and the melodies of folk music. I love the tonality of alt-pop. Obviously, I'm obsessed with pop and pop artists. So I'm going to try and take all of my sort of influences ... and make something that I like.Rodrigo described her ambition for her debut project, Sour, was a \"super versatile\" body of work that mainly blends mainstream pop, folk, and alternative rock genres,[1] alongside elements of pop-punk, country and grunge.[13] She stated that it is inspired by the works of her favorite singer-songwriters, such as Alanis Morissette, Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves,[14] and the \"pouty\", \"angsty\" sound of rock acts like No Doubt and the White Stripes.[15] Rodrigo also cited her mother Jennifer's musical tastes as an influence, as it was her who introduced young Rodrigo to metal, punk and 1990s alternative rock.[12]Rodrigo's vision for the album's lyrics was to explore a variety of \"sour\" emotions that young women \"are often shamed for\", such as anger, jealousy and sadness. The album title refers to the concept of \"awesome things\" in Rodrigo's life \"progressively going sour\" as she gets older, representing a specific \"slice\" of her life as a 17-year-old, \"its unending growing pains and surprising discoveries.\"[15] She insisted this point in her interview to The Guardian as well, saying Sour is an \"intrinsically young\" album that is aimed at honoring \"acute teenage feelings\". Rodrigo explained, \"something I'm really proud of is that this record talks about emotions that are hard to talk about or aren't really socially acceptable especially for girls: anger, jealousy, spite, sadness, they're frowned-upon as bitchy and moaning and complaining or whatever. But I think they're such valid emotions.\"[16]According to Rodrigo, the word \"sour\" has many different meanings and she tried to write a song titled \"Sour\" for a long time but was unsuccessful in doing so, making her realize that it is an \"all-encompassing\" trope that covered the sour portion of her life.[17] She tried to balance out the \"sour\" songs of the album with some love songs, in order to avoid being pigeonholed as \"the heartbreak girl\"; however, she eventually dropped the idea, to preserve her authenticity as a songwriter. She asserted that love and happiness were not the emotions she felt while making the album.[12] Nevertheless, Rodrigo did not want Sour to be filled with \"sad piano songs\" either, hence she infused danceability and upbeat arrangements into the record, evident in tracks such as \"Brutal\" and \"Good 4 U\".[18]Sour has been described as a genre-hopping pop,[19] pop-punk,[20] alternative pop,[21][22] and bedroom pop[23] record with synth-pop, dream pop, alternative rock, pop rock, and folk-pop elements.[24][25][26]  Stylistically, the album spans from energetic 1990s-inspired guitar rock to tender acoustic balladry driven by piano and fingerpicked guitars.[27][28] Craig Jenkins of Vulture categorized Sour as a \"post-genre\" record, one which materializes Rodrigo's aim to transcend boundaries of music genres and coalesce them.[26]The songs of Sour represent different perspectives to a single storyline of failed romance. The songwriting is characterized by self-aware[27] themes of insecurities, anger, revenge, envy, and jealousy, using detail-specific lyrics exuding vulnerability.[29][30][28]Sour opens with \"Brutal\", which was described as \"angsty\" and \"uptempo\" by Rodrigo. The song was characterized as an enjoyable, \"angrily insecure alt-rock tirade\" and \"playful and easy pop-punk\" that \"free falls into the depths of grungy rock\", with elements of indie rock.[31][32][33][34] \"Brutal\" was the last song written for the album; Rodrigo and Nigro wrote the track two weeks before she had to turn in the record. Rodrigo noted that the song represents her teenage years.[35] The song has \"thrashy\" guitars, and was reported to be a \"desire to defy any pop expectations that have been placed upon [Rodrigo] by fans, friends, executives, or exes\".[24] \"Traitor\", the second track, is an indie pop ballad with a folk instrumental.[36][37] Its lyrics have been described to consist of \"post-grief anger and bargaining\".[24] Furthermore, details on the lyrics also depict Rodrigo's ex moving on with another girl while she is unable to get over it as she tries to figure out what went wrong.[33]The fourth track, \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\", interpolates the piano line from Taylor Swift's \"New Year's Day\" (2017),[38] which was a result of Rodrigo singing \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" over the chords of the Swift song.[35] The song is described to be a \"regret-wracked\" tune.[24] Rodrigo revealed that she wrote the hook of the song from a text message, going on to say that she \"thought it would be a cool way to describe this toxic, sort of manipulative relationship\". The chirping birds at the beginning of the track were a result of Nigro recording them through a window at his house.[35] The seventh track, \"Enough For You\", is a \"simple\" and \"minimal\" bedroom pop song with \"searing\" lyrics and acoustic instrumentals.[39][33] Rodrigo described the song as \"very insecure and vulnerable, but [she] also love[s] how it's really hopeful\", referencing the line \"someday I'll be everything to somebody else\".[35] \"Happier\" serves as the eighth track, a piano-led song featuring lyrics admitting selfishness and exuding self-criticism.[33]Being angry, jealous, overly emotional or sad can often be framed as being bitchy or moany. I decided to shine a light on those feelings, even though that was uncomfortable to talk about. I've done all I can do. Everything else is out of my hands.The ninth track, \"Jealousy, Jealousy\", has been described as \"jazzy\",[18] \"serpentine\" and an \"alt-rock squall \u00e0 la\u00a0the Kills\" with a \"plucky bassline and a prowling piano build\".[24][29][33] Lyrics talk about the toxicity of social media and its addictiveness, displaying the obsessions of living a perfect life.[33] The stripped-down tenth track, \"Favorite Crime\", an indie pop and folk-pop song that incorporates a set of layered harmonies with a \"thinly veiled Bonnie and Clyde-type metaphor\".[36][40][24][41][33] It speaks about \"on the examination of glaring red flags that only appear in their true colors through the lens of hindsight\".[33]\"Hope Ur OK\", the closing track, has been reported to be a \"shimmering blessing to down-on-their-luck people Rodrigo has known\", and the sound of the chorus has been described as a benediction.[24] Lyrically, it steps away from Rodrigo's self-referential narratives to secondhand stories from her friends, rooting from her genuine sympathy to them.[33] Rodrigo revealed that the song makes her \"really emotional\", and that the song is \"super personal about people that [she] really love[s]\". On an appearance on The Zach Sang Show, Rodrigo described the placement of the track as the album's closer: \"I feel like it's super hopeful. Sour is a very sort of sad, angry, emotional record, and I wanted to end it with a song that was [reassuring]. It was really important for me to end this sort of somber record on that note.\"[35]On April 1, 2021, Rodrigo announced across her social media accounts that her debut album, with placeholder title *O*R, was scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.[42] Preorders for the album began the following day. On April 13, Rodrigo teased the album's title, and subsequently, revealed the album's title as Sour, posted its track listing and cover artwork on the same day.[43] It was released on May 21, 2021, via retail stores, digital music and streaming platforms, as well as on Rodrigo's website.[44] Vinyl LPs of Sour were released on August 20, 2021, in various colored variants, each of which were exclusively available at Rodrigo's webstore, Urban Outfitters, Target, Walmart, or Amazon.[45]Photographed by Grant Spanier,[46] the standard cover artwork of Sour depicts Rodrigo standing against a purple backdrop, wearing a fuzzy pale pink tank top and checkered bottoms. She sticks her tongue out, with her face covered in a variety of colorful stickers. The stickers on her tongue spell the album title. PopSugar observed that Rodrigo is also wearing a ring in the cover artwork, identical to a ring that Taylor Swift had gifted her earlier. The backside cover also has a purple background, featuring scattered stickers as well as the tracklist on a pearly-colored balloon that Rodrigo's hand is about to pop with a safety pin. In the alternative cover available for the Target-exclusive and vinyl editions of Sour, purple is again the dominant color, but stickers are not present.[47] Stickers also recur through the album artwork and promotional material, which followed a theme of scrapbooking in a school notebook.[48]Sour was supported by five singles, four of which charted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.[49] \"Drivers License\", Rodrigo's debut single, was released on January 8, 2021, as the lead single of Sour.[50] An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Matthew Dillon Cohen, was uploaded to Rodrigo's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release.[51] The song broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song and the biggest first week for a song on Spotify and on Amazon Music.[52] The song debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and made Rodrigo the youngest artist ever to debut atop the chart.[53] It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single also topped charts in the UK,[54] Canada,[55] Australia,[56] and many more countries.\"Deja Vu\" was announced as the second single on her social media accounts on March 29, 2021, and was released three days later along with its music video, directed by Allie Avital in Malibu.[57][58] The song debuted at number eight on the Hot 100, making Rodrigo the first artist in history to debut her first two singles in the top 10 of the chart.[49] It reached a new peak of number three after the release of Sour.[59]The third single, \"Good 4 U\", was announced on May 10, 2021, and was released on May 14.[60] Its music video, directed by Petra Collins, features Rodrigo as a revengeful cheerleader, making references to the 2000s' cult classic films Princess Diaries and Jennifer's Body.[61][62] The energetic song provided listeners the taste of a different side of Sour, departing from the slower and melancholic emotion of the preceding singles \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\".[63] \"Good 4 U\" debuted atop the Hot 100, garnering Rodrigo her second number-one song in the US and the second from Sour.[64]\"Traitor\" impacted US contemporary hit radio formats on August 10, 2021, as the fourth single from Sour.[65] Before it was promoted as a single, \"Traitor\" landed at number 9 on the Hot 100 upon the album release, charting alongside \"Good 4 U\" and \"Deja Vu\" in the top 10 region. Billboard remarked how \"Traitor\" registered impressive sales and streaming tallies for an album track.[66]\"Brutal\" received a music video on August 23, 2021,[67] before it impacted Italian contemporary hit radio formats through Universal Music Italy on September 3, 2021, as the fifth single from the album.[68] Before becoming a single, the song arrived at number 12 on the Hot 100, and landed atop the Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart.Rodrigo gave the debut performance of \"Drivers License\" on February 4, 2021, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[69] She has expressed excitement for a potential upcoming tour in support of the album after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.[70] A sneak-peek of the creation process of the album was featured in IMAX screenings of In the Heights (2021) on Mother's Day.[71]  On May 11, Rodrigo performed \"Drivers License\" at the 2021 Brit Awards held on The O2 Arena in London.[72] On May 12, 2021, a trailer to Sour was posted to Rodrigo's YouTube channel, which showed studio clips of herself and Nigro, and featured a snippet of \"Good 4 U\" which was set to release two days later.[73] She performed \"Drivers License\" and debuted \"Good 4 U\" live at Saturday Night Live on May 15, 2021, hosted by American actor Keegan-Michael Key.[60] On May 16, 2021, a hotline phone number (323-622-SOUR) was made available, which teased an unreleased track from Sour.[74] In the evening of May 20, 2021, Rodrigo appeared on YouTube's livestream of the official premiere party of Sour, as an episode for the platform's Released series. She played voice memos from her phone, discussed songs, interacted with fans, and exclusively performed the track \"Enough for You\".[75] Rodrigo gave interviews and appeared on the magazine covers of Billboard,[12] Interview,[76] Elle,[77] The Face,[15] NME,[13] Nylon,[78] and Variety.[18] On May 25, Rodrigo appeared on Vevo Lift to perform \"Favorite Crime\".[79]On June 29, 2021, a livestream concert film entitled Sour Prom aired on Rodrigo's YouTube channel, in celebration of Sour's success. It featured songs from the album performed in various locations, such as \"the back of a limo, on a prom dancefloor, in a darkroom, and accompanied by a marching band on a football field.\"[80] She also hosted a \"pre-party\" Q&A segment in which she answered questions on the album's creation. She then performed several live renditions of her Sour tracks, including \"Drivers License\" and \"Good 4 U\".[81] The film was described as \"the ultimate alternative prom experience\", after Rodrigo herself graduated high school recently.[82] The concert film later was nominated at the 2021 UK Music Video Awards in the category 'Best Special Video Project'.[83]On February 17, 2022, Rodrigo announced a documentary about Sour, titled Driving Home 2 U (A Sour Film), releasing to Disney+ on March 25, 2022. It was directed by Stacey Lee and produced by Interscope Films and Supper Club. According to a press release, the film captures Rodrigo's road trip from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, during which she began writing Sour. The film includes \"new live arrangements of her songs, intimate interviews, and never-before-seen footage from the making of the album.\"[84]To support Sour, Rodrigo has embarked on the Sour Tour, her first headlining concert tour. It covers North America and Europe with 47 dates. It commenced on April 5, 2022, in Portland, Oregon, and is set to conclude on July 7, 2022, in London. Gracie Abrams and Holly Humberstone are the opening acts for the North American dates, and Baby Queen for European dates.[85] On the tour, Rodrigo covered Avril Lavigne's \"Complicated\" at all tour dates. At the Toronto show in Canada on April 29, Lavigne joined Rodrigo as a surprise guest on stage to perform the song together for the first time.[86][87]Sour received widespread critical acclaim upon release, appearing on multiple year ends lists.[94] The general consensus was that the album is a strong debut record that mounts Rodrigo as the new face of \"Gen Z pop\".[95] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from publications, the album received a mean score of 83 based on 20 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89]Robin Murray of Clash hailed Sour as a \"bravura\" pop statement \"marked by excellence from front to back\". He described its 11 tracks as \"potential smash hit singles\", and complimented Rodrigo's bold lyricism, punchy execution, deeming her \"pop's newest icon, and one of its bravest voices\".[92] The A.V. Club's Tatiana Tenreyro designated Sour a contender for best pop album of 2021, and highlighted its lack of filler tracks. She stated each song depicts a different side to Rodrigo's artistry, embracing influences while still creating \"something fresh\".[96] Kate Solomon, writing for i, called Sour a \"surprisingly accomplished package\" and a \"stunning portrait of adolescence\".[97] NME critic Rhian Daly called Rodrigo a \"multidimensional\" artist writing detailed songs that \"go full-circle from being precisely personal to universally relatable\".[25]Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph opined Sour excels in modern production, striking an acoustic-electronic balance by combining Taylor Swift's traditional songcraft, Lorde's harmonies and Billie Eilish's whispery vocals with the brashness of Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne.[19] Also touching on these comparisons, fellow critic Robert Christgau said Rodrigo \"recalls her hero Taylor more than her West Coast homegirl Billie with bravely retro pre-track-and-hook structures and lyrics that map out the kind of emotional grounding all parents pray their kids achieve, the female ones especially\".[98] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times dubbed the album \"flawless Gen Z pop\" that ranges from crisp 1990s rock to acoustic balladry, and \"the most self-aware pop record in recent memory\".[27] Entertainment Weekly's Maura Johnston felt Sour's heaviness is bettered by Rodrigo's grace and self-awareness, and that she is not trying to be \"the next\" anyone, but instead distills her life and musical tastes into promising, \"powerful, hooky pop\".[24] Rolling Stone critic Angie Martoccio said, beyond her idols and inspirations, Rodrigo forged \"a path into an entirely new realm of pop\" in Sour, where she is \"unapologetically and enthusiastically her own guide\".[30]Variety's Chris Williman called Sour \"ridiculously good\", and \"unabashedly teenage\" atypical of most teen singers who often try to mimick adult music.[99] Praising Rodrigo's musical vision and Nigro's production, Rachel Saywitz, reviewing for The Line of Best Fit, said Sour swerves the conventional genres to work Rodrigo's wide taste.[100] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it a \"nuanced and often exceptional debut album\", traversing Rodrigo's evolving perspectives real-time.[101] The Independent critic Helen Brown thought Sour converts 21st-century adolescence into universally resonating \"story-songs\", and admired Rodrigo's \"disarming honesty\", using F-bombs unlike former teen stars who \"don't usually do that until they're onto the post-breakdown record\". She added its organic musicality breaks the \"shiny surfaces we've come to expect from such glossy girls.\"[93]Olivia Horn of Pitchfork called it a \"nimble and lightly chaotic collection of breakup tunes filled with melancholy and mischief\", with profanity typically prohibited by the morality clauses limiting Disney singers. However, Horn stated  Rodrigo is \"more invested in content than in craft\" at moments, settling for simple rhymes, self-evident phrasing, and a DIY recording quality that exposes imperfections in Rodrigo's voice.[29] Rachel Aroesti of The Guardian said Sour is polished \"pop euphoria\" that processes anger, jealousy and bewilderment, and is \"one of the most gratifyingly undignified breakup albums ever made\", but nevertheless, majority of it follows the style of \"Drivers License\", resulting in a lovely and thoughtful but unadventurous record.[41] Stereogum's Chris DeVille stated, though Rodrigo's lyrics \"can come off desperate and immature\" while the album's pace can be a \"wearisome slog\" at times, Sour works by weaponizing its drawbacks.[102] Regarding the album \"a youthful tour through heartbreak angst\" that weakens only when it \"plays too safe\", DIY's Jenessa Williams felt Rodrigo's \"truly soars\" when she heads strong, rather than victimizing herself in \"bitterness\".[103]Rodrigo received seven nominations at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Sour; Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Drivers License\"; and Best New Artist. She became the second youngest artist (18 years old) to be nominated for all four of the general categories in the same ceremony, after Billie Eilish (17, for the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020).[104] Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent were nominated for Album of the Year for Sour as songwriters credited for interpolation, but subsequently withdrawn by the Recording Academy as they were \"not actively involved\" in creating Sour.[105]Numerous critics and publications listed Sour in their year-end ranking of the best albums of 2021, often inside the top-ten.Sour was the most pre-added album on Apple Music during the week leading up to its release (May 14, 2021 to May 20, 2021), dethroning Billie Eilish's Happier Than Ever (2021).[119] Upon release, Sour garnered 385 million streams in its first week on global Spotify\u2014the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist on the platform, beating the former record set by Ariana Grande's Thank U, Next (2019).[120] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that Rodrigo was the world's fourth best-selling female artist of 2021, behind Swift, Adele and Eilish.[121]Following the debuts of \"Drivers License\" and \"Good 4 U\" at the number one spot of the US Billboard Hot 100, Sour became the first debut album in history to have two songs debut atop the chart, and overall the fourth album to do so.[122]Sour debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with 295,000 album-equivalent units, of which 72,000 were album sales,[123] and spent a total of five weeks at the spot, becoming the longest reigning number-one album by a female artist in 2021.[124][note 1] At the time, the 295,000 sum marked the biggest opening week for any album in 2021.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Lorde": "Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known professionally as Lorde (/l\u0254\u02d0rd/ LORD), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Taking inspiration from aristocracy for her stage name, she is known for her unconventional musical styles and introspective songwriting. Her music is primarily electropop with elements of dream pop and indie-electro.Lorde expressed interest in performing at local venues in her early teens. She signed with Universal Music Group (UMG) in 2009 and collaborated with producer Joel Little in 2011 to start recording music. Their first effort, an extended play (EP) titled The Love Club, was self-released in 2012 for free download on SoundCloud before UMG's commercial release in 2013. The EP's international chart-topping single \"Royals\" helped raise Lorde to prominence. Her debut studio album Pure Heroine was released that same year to critical and commercial success. The following year, Lorde curated the soundtrack for the 2014 film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 and recorded several tracks, including the single \"Yellow Flicker Beat\". Her second studio album Melodrama (2017) received widespread critical acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200. She ventured into indie folk and psychedelic styles on her third studio album Solar Power (2021).Lorde's accolades include two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, and a Golden Globe nomination. She appeared in Time's list of the most influential teenagers in 2013 and 2014, and the 2014 edition of Forbes 30 Under 30. In addition to her solo work, she has co-written songs for other artists, including Broods and Bleachers. As of June\u00a02017[update], Lorde has sold over five million albums worldwide.Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor was born on 7 November 1996 in Takapuna, New Zealand, a suburb of Auckland,[1] to poet Sonja Yelich (Croatian: Jeli\u0107) and civil engineer Vic O'Connor.[2] Her mother was born to Croatian immigrants from the region of Dalmatia, while her father is of Irish descent.[3] They announced their engagement in 2014, after a 30-year relationship,[4] and they married in a 2017 private ceremony in Cheltenham Beach.[5] Lorde holds dual New Zealand and Croatian citizenship.[6]Lorde is the second of four children: she has an older sister Jerry, a younger sister India, and a younger brother Angelo.[7] They were raised in Auckland's North Shore suburbs of Devonport and Bayswater.[8][9] At age five, she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills.[10] Her mother encouraged her to read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence. More specifically, she cites the young adult dystopian novel Feed (2002) by M.T. Anderson as well as authors J.D. Salinger, Raymond Carver and Janet Frame for influencing her songwriting.[9]After a suggestion from a school instructor, her mother had her take the Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities to determine her intelligence. The results concluded that Lorde, age 6, was a gifted child.[11] She was briefly enrolled at George Parkyn Centre, a gifted education organisation. Sonja unenrolled her, however, citing social development concerns.[11] As a child, Lorde attended Vauxhall School and then Belmont Intermediate School in her early teens.[12] While attending Vauxhall, she placed third and first respectively in the North Shore Primary Schools' Speech competition, a national contest, in 2006 and 2007.[13][14] Lorde and her Belmont team were named the runner-up in the 2009 Kids' Lit Quiz World Finals, a global literature competition for students aged 10 to 14.[12]In May 2009, Lorde and her friend Louis McDonald won the Belmont Intermediate School annual talent show as a duo.[15] In August that year, Lorde and McDonald made a guest appearance on Jim Mora's Afternoons show on Radio New Zealand. There, they performed covers of Pixie Lott's \"Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\" and Kings of Leon's \"Use Somebody\".[16] McDonald's father then sent his recordings of the duo covering \"Mama Do\" and Duffy's \"Warwick Avenue\" to Universal Music Group (UMG)'s A&R executive Scott Maclachlan.[17] Maclachlan subsequently signed her to UMG for development.[18]Lorde was also part of the Belmont Intermediate School band Extreme; the band placed third in the North Shore Battle of the Bands finals at the Bruce Mason Centre, Takapuna, Auckland on 18 November 2009.[19] In 2010, Lorde and McDonald formed a duet called \"Ella & Louis\" and performed covers live on a regular basis at local venues, including caf\u00e9s in Auckland and the Victoria Theatre in Devonport.[20] In 2011, UMG hired vocal coach Frances Dickinson to give her singing lessons twice a week for a year.[21] During this time, Maclachlan attempted to partner Lorde with several different producers and songwriters, but without success.[18][22] As she began writing songs, she learned how to \"put words together\" by reading short fiction.[23]Lorde performed her original songs for the first time at the Victoria Theatre in November 2011.[20] In December, Maclachlan paired Lorde with Joel Little, a songwriter, record producer, and former Goodnight Nurse lead singer. The pair recorded five songs for an extended play (EP) at Little's Golden Age Studios in Morningside, Auckland, and finished within three weeks.[24] While working on her music career, she attended Takapuna Grammar School from 2010 to 2013, completing Year 12.[25] She later chose not to return in 2014 to attend Year 13.[26]When Lorde and Little had finished their first collaborative effort, The Love Club EP, Maclachlan applauded it as a \"strong piece of music\", but worried if the EP could profit because Lorde was obscure at the time.[18] In November 2012, the singer self-released the EP through her SoundCloud account for free download.[8] UMG commercially released The Love Club in March 2013 after it had been downloaded 60,000 times, which signaled that Lorde had attracted a range of audiences.[18][27] It peaked at number two in New Zealand and Australia.[28] \"Royals\", the EP's single, helped Lorde rise to prominence after it became a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million units worldwide.[29] It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making Lorde, then aged 16, the youngest artist to earn a number-one single in the United States since Tiffany in 1987,[30] and has since been certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[31] The track won two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year at the 56th ceremony.[32] From late 2013 to early 2016, Lorde was in a relationship with New Zealand photographer James Lowe.[33]Lorde's debut studio album Pure Heroine containing the single \"Royals\" was released in September 2013 to critical acclaim;[17] it appeared on several year-end best album lists.[34] The album received considerable attention for its portrayal of suburban teenage disillusionment and critiques of mainstream culture.[35] In the United States, the album sold over one million copies in February 2014, becoming the first debut album by a female artist since Adele's 2008 album 19 to achieve the feat.[36] Pure Heroine earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album,[32] and had sold four million copies worldwide as of May 2017.[37] Three other singles were released from the album: \"Tennis Court\" reached number one in New Zealand,[38] while \"Team\" charted at number six in the United States,[39] and \"Glory and Gore\" was released exclusively to US radio.[40]In November 2013, Lorde signed a publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing, worth a reported US$2.5\u00a0million, after a bidding war between companies including Sony Music Entertainment and her label UMG. The agreement gave the publisher the right to license Lorde's music for films and advertising.[41] Later that month, Lorde was featured on the soundtrack for the 2013 film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, performing a cover of Tears for Fears' 1985 song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\".[42] Time included her on their lists of the most influential teenagers in the world in 2013 and 2014.[43][44] Forbes also placed her on their 2014 edition of 30 Under 30; she was the youngest individual to be featured.[45] Billboard featured her on their 21 Under 21 list in 2013,[46] 2014,[47] and 2015.[48]In the first half of 2014, Lorde performed at festivals including the Laneway Festival in Sydney,[49] the three South American editions of Lollapalooza\u2014Chile,[50] Argentina,[51] Brazil[52]\u2014and the Coachella Festival in California.[53] She subsequently embarked on an international concert tour, commencing in North America in early 2014.[54] Amidst her solo activities, Lorde joined the surviving members of Nirvana to perform \"All Apologies\" during the band's induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014.[55] Band members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl explained that they selected Lorde because her songs represented \"Nirvana aesthetics\" for their perceptive lyrics.[56] Lorde also curated the accompanying soundtrack for the 2014 film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1, overseeing the collation of the album's content as well as recording four tracks, including its lead single \"Yellow Flicker Beat\".[57] In 2015, the track earned Lorde a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song.[58] Later that year, she was featured on British electronic duo Disclosure's song \"Magnets\" off their 2015 album Caracal.[59]In January 2016, Lorde relocated to Herne Bay, an affluent suburb in Auckland.[60] At the 2016 Brit Awards in February, Lorde and David Bowie's final touring band gave a tribute performance of his 1971 song \"Life on Mars\".[61] Pianist Mike Garson, a frequent band member for Bowie, explained that Bowie's family and management selected Lorde because he admired her and felt she was \"the future of music\".[62] Later that year, Lorde co-wrote \"Heartlines\", a song by New Zealand music duo Broods from their 2016 album Conscious.[63]The lead single from her second studio album Melodrama, \"Green Light\",[64] was released in March 2017 to critical acclaim; several publications ranked it as one of the best songs of the year, NME and The Guardian placing it in the top spot on their respective lists.[65] It achieved moderate commercial success, reaching number one in New Zealand, number four in Australia and number nine in Canada.[66] Later that month, she co-wrote and provided background vocals for American indie pop band Bleachers's song \"Don't Take the Money\",[67] taken from their 2017 record Gone Now.[68]On Melodrama, Lorde's songwriting showed signs of maturity with introspective, post-breakup lyrics.[69][70] The album was released in June 2017 to widespread critical acclaim; Metacritic placed it second on their list of the best-received records of 2017 based on inclusions in publications' year-end lists, behind Kendrick Lamar's Damn.[71] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, giving Lorde her first number-one album on the chart,[72] and on record charts of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.[73] It earned a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year at the 60th ceremony.[74] Two other singles from the album were released: \"Perfect Places\" and a remix of \"Homemade Dynamite\" featuring Khalid, Post Malone and SZA.[75]To promote Melodrama, Lorde embarked on an international concert tour, the first leg of which took place in Europe in late 2017, featuring Khalid as the supporting act.[76] She later announced the North American leg, held in March 2018, with Run the Jewels, Mitski and Tove Styrke as opening acts.[77] A political controversy occurred in December 2017 when Lorde cancelled her scheduled June 2018 concert in Israel following an online campaign by Palestinian solidarity activists supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.[78] While Lorde did not explicitly indicate her reasons for the cancellation, she admitted that she had been unaware of the political turmoil there and \"the right decision at this time is to cancel\".[79] Pro-Palestine groups welcomed her decision,[80] while pro-Israel groups were critical of the cancellation.[81] Billboard included Lorde on their 2017 edition of 21 Under 21,[82] while Forbes included her in their 30 Under 30 Asia list.[83]Lorde revealed on 20 May 2020 that she started working on her third studio album with Antonoff following the death of her dog Pearl.[84] In November 2020, she announced the release of Going South, a book documenting her January 2019 visit to Antarctica with photos taken by photographer Harriet Were.[85]On 25 May 2021, Lorde was announced as a headlining act for Primavera Sound's June 2022 festival, her first live show performance in over two years.[86] On 7 June, Lorde posted an image on her website with the caption \"Solar Power\", along with the message: \"Arriving in 2021 ... Patience is a virtue.\"[87] \"Solar Power\" was released on 10 June,[88] as the lead single from her third studio album of the same name, which was released on 20 August to mixed reviews.[89][90] \"Stoned at the Nail Salon\"  and \"Mood Ring\"  were released as the album's second and third singles on 21 July and 17 August, respectively.[91][92]Lorde released Te Ao M\u0101rama on 9 September 2021 as a companion piece to Solar Power. The EP is sung entirely in te reo M\u0101ori, and was translated by Hana Mereraiha. Other translators included Sir T\u012bmoti K\u0101retu and H\u0113mi Kelly. The project was led by Dame Hinewehi Mohi.[93] All proceeds from the album are going towards two New Zealand-based charities: Forest and Bird and Te Hua Kawariki.[94]Lorde grew up listening to American jazz and soul musicians Billie Holiday, Sam Cooke, Etta James, and Otis Redding, whose music she admires for \"harvesting their suffering.\"[9] She also listened to her parents' favourite records by the likes of Cat Stevens, Neil Young, and Fleetwood Mac in her early years.[17] During production of Pure Heroine, Lorde cited influences from electronic music producers,[95] including SBTRKT, Grimes,[96] and Sleigh Bells,[97] impressed by \"their vocals in a really interesting way, whether it might be chopping up a vocal part or really lash or layering a vocal.\"[21] Lorde also stated that she was inspired by the initially hidden identities of Burial and the Weeknd, explaining, \"I feel like mystery is more interesting.\"[8] Other inspirations include Grace Jones,[98] James Blake, Yeasayer, Animal Collective, Bon Iver,[99] the Smiths,[95] Arcade Fire,[9] Laurie Anderson,[10] Kanye West, Prince,[100] and David Bowie.[101]Lyrically, Lorde cited her mother, a poet, as the primary influence for her songwriting.[17] She also named several authors, including Kurt Vonnegut,[102] Raymond Carver,[103] Wells Tower,[104] Tobias Wolff,[103] Claire Vaye Watkins,[104] Sylvia Plath,[103] Walt Whitman,[103] and T. S. Eliot as lyrical inspirations, particularly noting their sentence structures.[96] When writing her second album, Melodrama, Lorde took inspiration from the melodic styles of a variety of musicians, including Phil Collins,[105] Don Henley,[69] Rihanna,[106] Florence + the Machine,[107] Tom Petty,[108] Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen,[109] and Robyn.[110] During the recording process, Lorde stated that Frank Ocean's 2016 album Blonde inspired her to eschew \"traditional song structures.\"[105] She frequently listened to Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland while riding subways in New York City and on taxi rides on the way home from parties in her hometown of Auckland.[105] She cited the 1950 science fiction short story \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" by Ray Bradbury as inspiration for much of Melodrama's story, relating it to her own realities she faced.[108]Lorde is noted for her unconventional pop sound and introspective songwriting.[114] In a 2017 interview with NME, she declared \"I don't think about staying in my genre lane\".[108] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine characterised her style as primarily electropop.[115] Upon the release of Pure Heroine, contemporary critics described her music as electropop,[113] art pop,[116] dream pop,[117] indie pop,[118] and indie-electro,[119] with influences of hip hop.[120] Melodrama was a departure from the hip hop-oriented minimalist style of its predecessor, incorporating piano instrumentation and maximalist electronic beats.[121]Before Melodrama, Lorde only sang and did not play musical instruments on her records or onstage, saying, \"[My] voice needs to have the focus. My vocal-scape is really important\".[122] PopMatters described Lorde's vocals as \"unique and powerfully intriguing\",[117] while Billboard characterised her voice as \"dynamic, smoky and restrained\".[123] For the Melodrama World Tour, however, she played a drum pad sampler,[124] and xylophone onstage in some performances.[125] Shortly after finishing her tour, Lorde said she had started learning to play the piano.[126] Vice noted that her songs incorporated the mixolydian mode, a melodic structure used in \"blues-based and alternative rock\" music, which set her songs apart from those in pop music for not fitting a common major or minor chord.[127]Regarding her songwriting process, Lorde explained that the foundation to her songs began with the lyrics, which could sometimes stem from a singular word meant to summarise a specific idea she had tried to identify.[9] For \"Tennis Court\", Lorde wrote the music before lyrics.[128] She stated that the songwriting on Pure Heroine developed from the perspective of an observer.[69] Similarly, in an interview with NME, Lorde acknowledged that she used words of inclusion throughout her debut album, while her follow-up Melodrama presented a shift to first-person narrative, employing more introspective lyrics inspired by Lorde's personal struggles post-breakup and viewpoints on post-teenage maturity.[108] Lorde's neurological condition chromesthesia influenced her songwriting on the album; it led her to arrange colours according to each song's theme and emotion.[69]Lorde's stage name bears her fascination with \"royals and aristocracy\"; she added an \"e\" after the name Lord, which she felt was too masculine, to make it more feminine.[129] She described her public image as something that \"naturally\" came to her and was identical to her real-life personality.[130] Lorde identifies as a feminist.[131] The New Zealand Herald opined that her feminist ideology was different from her contemporaries due to Lorde's disinterest in sexualised performances.[132] She proclaimed herself in an interview with V magazine as a \"hugely sex-positive person\", saying, \"I have nothing against anyone getting naked.\u00a0... I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better\".[133]Critical reception of Lorde is generally positive, with praise concentrated on her maturity both musically and lyrically.[134] The New York Times called her \"the pop prodigy\" who was not conformed to boundaries and always sought experimentation.[69] Billboard recognised Lorde as a spokesperson for a \"female rock resurgence\" by introducing her works to rock and alternative radio, which had seen a traditional male dominance.[135] The publication also named her the \"New Queen of Alternative\" in a 2013 cover story.[8] Journalist Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic towards Lorde's styles, labelling the singer as \"a pop property\" that was indistinguishable from other mainstream artists.[136]Lorde's critiques of mainstream culture on Pure Heroine earned her the title \"the voice of her generation\",[17] a label she dismissed, saying that \"young people have never needed a specialised spokesperson\".[108] Jon Caramanica, writing for The New York Times, credited Lorde for bringing forth a \"wave of female rebellion\" to mainstream audiences that embraced an \"anti-pop\" sentiment.[137] Sharing a similar viewpoint, Rolling Stone and NPR credited her debut studio album Pure Heroine as the foundation of that transformation.[111] Several analysts also noted Lorde's influence on the music trends of the 2010s,[138] and have credited the singer with paving the way for the current generation of alternative-leaning pop artists.[139] She placed at number 12 on NPR's 2018 readers poll of the most influential female musicians of the 21st century.[140]Her onstage persona, particularly her signature unchoreographed dancing, has polarised audiences. Her detractors have described her dance moves as \"awkward\" in comparison to contemporary stage performers.[141] The Fader expressed that she should be celebrated for her dancing as it is \"more freeform and spontaneous\" than structured choreography and \"speaks an entirely different expressive language\". The publication further elaborated that her \"stage presence [is] more impactful than the average pop performance\".[142]Lorde has been involved in several philanthropic causes. \"The Love Club\" was included in the 2013 charity album Songs for the Philippines to support the people in the Philippines who suffered from Typhoon Haiyan.[143] In 2015, Lorde recorded \"Team Ball Player Thing\", a charity single, as part of the supergroup Kiwis Cure Batten. All sales from the song went towards research for the cure of Batten disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder.[144] Later that year, the singer was featured in the compilation album The Art of Peace: Songs for Tibet II to raise funds for the preservation of the Tibetan culture.[145] The following year, Lorde made a NZ$20,000 donation to Fuel the Need, a New Zealand charity that provides lunches for underprivileged schoolchildren.[146] In 2018, she donated NZ$5,000 to Starship Hospital to fund the purchase of \"five new portable neurology monitors.\"[147] Lorde became a patron of MusicHelps, formerly the New Zealand Music Foundation, a musical charity helping New Zealanders who are vulnerable to or experiencing serious health issues, in November 2018.[148]After her breakthrough, Lorde won four New Zealand Music Awards at the 2013 ceremony.[149] The single \"Royals\" earned the APRA Silver Scroll Award,[150] and two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year.[32] In 2015, she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song as a songwriter for \"Yellow Flicker Beat\".[58] Her second studio album Melodrama received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year at the 60th ceremony.[151] Lorde has received two Brit Awards for International Female Solo Artist.[152] The singer has also won two Billboard Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards.[153] She had sold over five million albums worldwide as of June 2017[154] and 15 million certified single units in the United States.[155]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Slate_(magazine)": "Slate is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics, and culture in the United States. It was created in 1996 by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, initially under the ownership of Microsoft as part of MSN. In 2004, it was purchased by The Washington Post Company (later renamed the Graham Holdings Company), and since 2008 has been managed by The Slate Group, an online publishing entity created by Graham Holdings. Slate is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C.[1]Slate, which is updated throughout the day, covers politics, arts and culture, sports, and news. According to its former editor-in-chief Julia Turner, the magazine is \"not fundamentally a breaking news source\", but rather aimed at helping readers to \"analyze and understand and interpret the world\" with witty and entertaining writing.[2] As of mid-2015, it publishes about 1,500 stories per month.[3]A French version, slate.fr, was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including Jean-Marie Colombani, Eric Leser, and economist Jacques Attali. Among them, the founders hold 50 percent in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15 percent.[4][5] In 2011, slate.fr started a separate site covering African news, Slate Afrique, with a Paris-based editorial staff.[6]As of 2021,[update] the magazine is both ad-supported and has a membership model with a metered paywall. It is known, and sometimes criticized, for having adopted contrarian views, giving rise to the term \"Slate Pitches\".[7][8][9] It has a generally liberal editorial stance.[10][11][12]Slate features regular and semi-regular columns such as Explainer, Moneybox, Spectator, Transport, and Dear Prudence. Many of the articles are short (less than 2,000 words) and argument-driven. Around 2010, the magazine also began running long-form journalism. Many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the \"Fresca Fellowships\", so-called because former editor Plotz liked the soft drink Fresca. \"The idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job, but instead working on a long, ambitious project of some sort,\" Plotz said in an interview.[13]Slate introduced a paywall-based business model in 1998 that attracted up 20,000 subscribers but was later abandoned.[14] A similar subscription model was implemented in April 2001 by Slate's independently owned competitor, Salon.com.Slate started a daily feature, \"Today's Pictures\", on November 30, 2005, which featured 15\u201320 photographs from the archive at Magnum Photos that share a common theme. The column also features two Flash animated \"Interactive Essays\" a month.On its 10th anniversary, Slate unveiled a redesigned website. It introduced Slate V in 2007,[15] an online video magazine with content that relates to or expands upon their written articles. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned under the guidance of design director Vivian Selbo.Slate was nominated for four digital National Magazine Awards in 2011 and won the NMA for General Excellence. In the same year, the magazine laid off several high-profile journalists, including co-founder Jack Shafer and Timothy Noah (author of the Chatterbox column).[16] At the time, it had around 40 full-time editorial staff.[16] The following year, a dedicated ad sales team was created.[17]Slate launched the \"Slate Book Review\" in 2012, a monthly books section edited by Dan Kois.[18]The next year, Slate became profitable after preceding years had seen layoffs and falling ad revenues.[2]In 2014, Slate introduced a paywall system called \"Slate Plus\", offering ad-free podcasts and bonus materials. A year later, it had attracted 9,000 subscribers generating about $500,000 in annual revenue.[14]Slate moved all content behind a metered paywall for international readers in June 2015, explaining \"our U.S.-based sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers, many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience. ...The end result is that, outside the United States, we are not covering our costs.\"[19] At the same time, it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall.[3]Since 2006,[8] Slate has been known for publishing contrarian pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter hashtag in 2009.[9] The Columbia Journalism Review has defined Slate pitches as \"an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever,\" and in explaining its success wrote \"Readers want to click on Slate Pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic\".[20]In 2014, Slate's then editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of Slate's \"distinctive\" brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site's journalism. \"We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them.\"[2]In a 2019 article for the site, Slate contributor Daniel Engber reflected on the changes that had occurred on the site since he started writing for it 15 years previously.  He suggested that its original worldview, influenced by its founder Kinsley and described by Engber as \"feisty, surprising, debate-club centrist-by-default\" and \"liberal contrarianism\", had shifted towards \"a more reliable, left-wing slant\", whilst still giving space for heterodox opinions, albeit \"tempered by other, graver duties\". He argued that this was necessary within the context of a \"Manichean age of flagrant cruelty and corruption\", although he also acknowledged that it could be \"a troubling limitation\".[21]According to NiemanLab, Slate has been involved in podcasts \"almost from the very beginning\" of the medium.[22] Its first podcast offering, released on July 15, 2005,[23] featured selected stories from the site read by Andy Bowers, who had joined Slate after leaving NPR in 2003.[22][24] By June 2012, Slate had expanded their lineup to 19 podcasts, with Political Gabfest and Culture Gabfest being the most popular.[22] This count had shrunk to 14 by February 2015, with all receiving six million downloads per month.[24] The podcasts are \"a profitable part of [Slate's] business\"; the magazine charges more for advertising in its podcasts than in any of its other content.[22]Slate podcasts have gotten longer over the years. The original Gabfest ran 15 minutes; by 2012, most ran about 45 minutes.[22]Jacob Weisberg was Slate's editor from 2002 until 2008. Weisberg's deputy editor David Plotz then became editor until July 2014,[25] when he was replaced by Julia Turner.Turner resigned as editor of Slate in October 2018.[26]Jared Hohlt became editor-in-chief on April 1, 2019.[27]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Generation_Z": "Generation Z (or Gen Z for short), colloquially also known as zoomers,[1][2] is the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials and preceding Generation Alpha. Researchers and popular media use the mid to late 1990s as starting birth years and the 2010s as ending birth years. Most members of Generation Z are children of Generation X.[3]As the first social generation to have grown up with access to the Internet and portable digital technology from a young age, members of Generation Z have been dubbed \"digital natives\",[4][5] even though they are not necessarily digitally literate.[6] Moreover, the negative effects of screen time are most pronounced on adolescents compared to younger children.[7] Compared to previous generations, members of Generation Z in some developed nations tend to be well-behaved, abstemious, and risk-averse.[8] They tend to live more slowly than their predecessors when they were their age,[9][10] have lower rates of teenage pregnancies, and consume alcohol less often,[11][12] but not necessarily other psychoactive drugs.[13][14] Generation Z teenagers are more concerned than older generations with academic performance and job prospects,[8][9] and are better at delaying gratification than their counterparts from the 1960s, despite concerns to the contrary.[15] Sexting among adolescents has grown in prevalence though the consequences of this remain poorly understood.[16] Meanwhile, youth subcultures have been quieter, though they have not necessarily disappeared.[17][18]Globally, there is evidence that the average age of pubertal onset among girls has decreased considerably compared to the 20th century,[19][20] with implications for their welfare and their future.[19][21][22][23] In addition, adolescents and young adults in Generation Z have higher rates of allergies,[24][25] higher awareness and diagnoses of mental health problems,[8][11][26][27] and are more likely to be sleep-deprived.[5][28][29] In many countries, Gen Z youth are more likely to have diagnosed intellectual disabilities and psychiatric disorders than older generations.[30][31]Around the world, members of Generation Z are spending more time on electronic devices and less time reading books than before,[32][33][34] with implications for their attention span,[35][36] their vocabulary[37][38] and thus their school grades,[39] as well as their future in the modern economy.[32] In Asia, educators in the 2000s and 2010s typically sought out and nourished top students whereas in Western Europe and the United States, the emphasis was on low-performers.[40] In addition, East Asian and Singaporean students consistently earned the top spots in international standardized tests during the 2010s.[41][42][43][44]While there is no scientific process for deciding when a name has stuck, the momentum is clearly behind Gen Z.Michael Dimmock, Pew Research Center[45]The name Generation Z is a reference to the fact that it is the second generation after Generation X, continuing the alphabetical sequence from Generation Y (Millennials).[46][47]Other proposed names for the generation include iGeneration,[48] Homeland Generation,[49] Net Gen,[48] Digital Natives,[48] Neo-Digital Natives,[50][51] Pluralist Generation,[48] Internet Generation,[52] Centennials,[53] and Post-Millennials.[54] The term Internet Generation is in reference to the fact that the generation is the first to have been born after the mass-adoption of the Internet.[52]Psychology professor and author Jean Twenge used the term iGeneration (or iGen for short), originally intending to use it as the title of her 2006 book about Millennials, Generation Me, before being overruled by her publisher, Atria Publishing Group. At that time, there were iPods and iMac computers but no iPhones or iPads. Twenge later used the term for her 2017 book iGen. The name has also been asserted to have been created by demographer Cheryl Russell in 2009.[48]In 2014, author Neil Howe coined the term Homeland Generation as a continuation of the Strauss\u2013Howe generational theory with William Strauss. The term Homeland refers to being the first generation to enter childhood after protective surveillance state measures, like the Department of Homeland Security, were put into effect following the September 11 attacks.[49]The Pew Research Center surveyed the various names for this cohort on Google Trends in 2019 and found that in the U.S., the term Generation Z was overwhelmingly the most popular. The Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries both have official entries for Generation Z.[45]In Japan, the cohort is described as Neo-Digital Natives, a step beyond the previous cohort described as Digital Natives. Digital Natives primarily communicate by text or voice, while Neo-Digital Natives use video, video-telephony, and movies. This emphasizes the shift from PC to mobile and text to video among the Neo-Digital population.[50][51]Zoomer is an informal term used to refer to members of Generation Z, often in an ironic, humorous, or mocking tone.[2] It combines the shorthand boomer, referring to baby boomers, with the \"Z\" from Generation Z. Prior to this, zoomer was used in the 2000s to describe particularly active baby boomers.[1] Zoomer in its current incarnation skyrocketed in popularity in 2018, when it was used in a 4chan internet meme mocking Gen Z adolescents via a Wojak caricature dubbed a \"Zoomer\".[55][56] Merriam-Webster's records suggest the use of the term zoomer in the sense of Generation Z dates back at least as far as 2016. It was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in October 2021.[1]The Oxford Dictionaries describes Generation Z as \"the generation reaching adulthood in the second decade of the 21st century.\"[57] The Oxford Learner's Dictionaries describes Gen Z as \"the group of people who were born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s\".[58] The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines Generation Z as \"the generation of people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\"[59]Statistics Canada describe Generation Z as spanning from 1993 to 2011.[60][61] Psychologist Jean Twenge has defined Generation Z as the \"iGeneration\" using a range of those born between 1995 and 2012.[62] Australia's McCrindle Research Centre defines Generation Z as those born between 1995 and 2009.[63] Various media outlets have used 1995 as the starting birth year to describe Gen Z, including United Press International,[64] Financial Times,[65][66] CNBC,[67] and Bloomberg Law.[68] The Center for Generational Kinetics defines Generation Z as those born from 1996 onward.[69]The Pew Research Center specified 1997 as their starting birth year for Generation Z, choosing this date for \"different formative experiences\", such as new technological developments and socioeconomic trends, as well as growing up in a world after the September 11 attacks.[45] Pew has not specified an endpoint for Generation Z, but used 2012 as a tentative endpoint for their 2019 report.[45] The United States Library of Congress explains that \"defining generations is not an exact science\" although cites Pew to define Generation Z.[70] Major media outlets have cited Pew's definition including The New York Times,[71] The Wall Street Journal,[72] PBS,[73] and The Washington Post.[74] William H. Frey, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, defines Generation Z as those born from 1997 to 2012.[75][76] Gallup[77] and Ipsos MORI[78] start Generation Z at 1997. A US Census publication in 2020 described Generation Z as the \u201cyoung and mobile\u201d population with oldest members of the cohort born after 1996.[79]Individuals born in the Millennial and Generation Z cusp years have been identified as a \"microgeneration\" with characteristics of both generations. Names given for these cuspers include Zillennials[80][81] and Zennials.[82][83]The Economist has described Generation Z as a more educated, well-behaved, stressed and depressed generation in comparison to previous generations.[8] In 2016, the Varkey Foundation and Populus conducted an international study examining the attitudes of over 20,000 people aged 15 to 21 in twenty countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They found that Gen Z youth were happy overall with the states of affairs in their personal lives (59%). The most unhappy young people were from South Korea (29%) and Japan (28%) while the happiest hailed from Indonesia (90%) and Nigeria (78%) (see right). In order to determine the overall 'happiness score' for each country, researchers subtracted the percentage of people who said they were unhappy from that of those who said they were happy. The most important sources of happiness were being physically and mentally healthy (94%), having a good relationship with one's family (92%), and one's friends (91%). In general, respondents who were younger and male tended to be happier. Religious faith came in last at 44%. Nevertheless, religion was a major source of happiness for Gen Z youth from Indonesia (93%), Nigeria (86%), Turkey (71%), China, and Brazil (both 70%). The top reasons for anxiety and stress were money (51%) and school (46%); social media and having access to basic resources (such as food and water) finished the list, both at 10%. Concerns over food and water were most serious in China (19%), India (16%), and Indonesia (16%); young Indians were also more likely than average to report stress due to social media (19%).[84]According to the aforementioned study by the Varkey Foundation, the most important personal values to these people were helping their families and themselves get ahead in life (both 27%), followed by honesty (26%). Looking beyond their local communities came last at 6%. Familial values were especially strong in South America (34%) while individualism and the entrepreneurial spirit proved popular in Africa (37%). People who influenced youths the most were parents (89%), friends (79%), and teachers (70%). Celebrities (30%) and politicians (17%) came last. In general, young men were more likely to be influenced by athletes and politicians than young women, who preferred books and fictional characters. Celebrity culture was especially influential in China (60%) and Nigeria (71%) and particularly irrelevant in Argentina and Turkey (both 19%). For young people, the most important factors for their current or future careers were the possibility of honing their skills (24%), and income (23%) while the most unimportant factors were fame (3%) and whether or not the organization they worked for made a positive impact on the world (13%). The most important factors for young people when thinking about their futures were their families (47%) and their health (21%); the welfare of the world at large (4%) and their local communities (1%) bottomed the list.[84]During the 2000s and especially the 2010s, youth subcultures that were as influential as what existed during the late 20th century became scarcer and quieter, at least in real life though not necessarily on the Internet, and more ridden with irony and self-consciousness due to the awareness of incessant peer surveillance.[17][18] In Germany, for instance, youth appears more interested in a more mainstream lifestyle with goals such as finishing school, owning a home in the suburbs, maintaining friendships and family relationships, and stable employment, rather than popular culture, glamor, or consumerism.[85]Boundaries between the different youth subcultures appear to have been blurred, and nostalgic sentiments have risen.[17][18]  Although an aesthetic dubbed 'cottagecore' in 2018 has been around for many years,[86] it has become a subculture of Generation Z,[87] especially on various social media networks in the wake of the mass lockdowns imposed to combat the spread of COVID-19.[88] It is a form of escapism[86] and aspirational nostalgia.[89] Cottagecore became even more popular thanks to the commercial success of the 2020 album Folklore by singer and songwriter Taylor Swift.[90][91][92]Nostalgia culture among Generation Z even extends to the usage of automobiles; in some countries, such as Indonesia, there are social media communities surrounding the purchasing used cars from earlier decades.[93]A survey conducted by OnePoll in 2018 found that while museums and heritage sites remained popular among Britons between the ages of 18 and 30, 19% did not visit one in the previous year. There was a big gender gap in attitudes, with 16% of female respondents and 26% of male respondents saying they never visited museums. Generation Z preferred staying home and watching television or browsing social media networks to visiting museums or galleries. The researchers also found that cheaper tickets, more interactive exhibitions, a greater variety of events, more food and beverage options, more convenient opening hours, and greater online presence could attract the attention of more young people.[94] On the other hand, vintage fashion is growing in popularity among Millennial and Generation Z consumers.[95]A 2019 report by Childwise found that children between the ages of five and sixteen in the U.K. spent an average of three hours each day online. Around 70% watched Netflix in the past week and only 10% watched their favorite programs on television. Among those who watched on-demand shows, 58% did so on a mobile phone, 51% on a television set, 40% via a tablet, 35% on a gaming console, and 27% on a laptop. About one out of four came from families with voice-command computer assistants such as Alexa. YouTube and Snapchat are the most popular gateways for music and video discovery. Childwise also found that certain television series aired between the 1990s and early 2000s, such as Friends, proved popular among young people of the 2010s.[96]Figures from Nielsen and Magna Global revealed that the viewership of children's cable television channels such as Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon continued their steady decline from the early 2010s, with little to no alleviating effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many parents and their children to stay at home. On the other hand, streaming services saw healthy growth.[97][98] Disney Channel in particular lost a third of their viewers in 2020, leading to closures in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Southeast Asia.[98]During the first two decades of the 21st century, writing and reading fan fiction became a prevalent activity worldwide. Demographic data from various depositories revealed that those who read and wrote fan fiction were overwhelmingly young, in their teens and twenties, and female.[99][100][101] For example, an analysis published in 2019 by data scientists Cecilia Aragon and Katie Davis of the site fanfiction.net showed that some 60 billion words of contents were added during the previous 20 years by 10 million English-speaking people whose median age was 15\u00bd years.[101] Fan fiction writers base their work on various internationally popular cultural phenomena such as K-pop, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Twilight, Doctor Who, Star Wars, and various works of Walt Disney,  known as 'canon', as well as other things they considered important to their lives, like natural disasters.[99][100][101] Much of fan fiction concerns the romantic pairing of fictional characters of interest, or 'shipping'.[102] Aragon and Davis argued that writing fan fiction stories could help young people combat social isolation and hone their writing skills outside of school in an environment of like-minded people where they can receive (anonymous) constructive feedback, what they call 'distributed mentoring'.[101] Informatics specialist Rebecca Black added that fan fiction writing could also be a useful resource for English-language learners. Indeed, the analysis of Aragon and Davis showed that for every 650 reviews a fan fiction writer receives, their vocabulary improved by one year of age, though this may not generalize to older cohorts.[103] On the other hand, children browsing fan fiction contents might be exposed to cyberbullying, crude comments, and other inappropriate materials.[102]Teenagers today have a plethora of options when it comes to music consumption, allowing for a highly personalized experience.[104] According to digital media company Sweety High's 2018 Gen Z Music Consumption & Spending Report, Spotify ranked first for music listening among Gen Z females, terrestrial radio ranked second, while YouTube was reported to be the preferred platform for music discovery.[105] Additional research showed that within the past few decades, popular music has gotten slower; that majorities of listeners young and old preferred older songs rather than keeping up with new ones; that the language of popular songs was becoming more negative psychologically; and that lyrics were becoming simpler and more repetitive, approaching one-word sheets, something measurable by observing how efficiently lossless compression algorithms (such as the LZ algorithm) handled them.[106] Sad music is quite popular among adolescents, though it can dampen their moods, especially among girls.[104]A 2020 survey conducted by The Center for Generational Kinetics, on 1000 members of Generation Z and 1000 Millennials, suggests that Generation Z still would like to travel, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the recession it induced. However, Generation Z is more likely to look carefully for package deals that would bring them the most value for their money, as many of them are already saving money for buying a house and for retirement, and they prefer more physically active trips. Mobile-friendly websites and social-media engagements are both important.[107]In New Zealand, child development psychologist Tom Nicholson noted a marked decline in vocabulary usage and reading among schoolchildren, many of whom are reluctant to use the dictionary. According to a 2008 survey by the National Education Monitoring Project, about one in five four-year and eight-year pupils read books as a hobby, a ten-percent drop from 2000.[37]In the United Kingdom, a survey of 2,000 parents and children from 2013 by Nielsen Book found that 36% of children read books for pleasure on a daily basis, 60% on a weekly basis, and 72% were read to by their parents at least once per week. Among British children, the most popular leisure activities were watching television (36%), reading (32%), social networking (20%), watching YouTube videos (17%), and playing games on mobile phones (16%). Between 2012 and 2013, children reported spending more time with video games, YouTube, and texting but less time reading (down eight percent). Among children between the ages of 11 and 17, the share of non-readers grew from 13% to 27% between 2012 and 2013, those who read once to thrice a month (occasional readers) dropped from 45% to 38%, those who read for no more than an average of 15 minutes per week (light readers) rose from 23% to 27%, those who read between 15 and 45 minutes per week (medium readers) declined from 23% to 17%, and those who read at least 45 minutes a week (heavy readers) grew slightly from 15% to 16%.[108]A survey by the National Literacy Trust from 2019 showed that only 26% of people below the age of 18 spent at least some time each day reading, the lowest level since records began in 2005. Interest in reading for pleasure declined with age, with five- to eight-year-olds being twice as likely to say they enjoyed reading compared to fourteen- to sixteen-year-olds. There was a significant gender gap in voluntary reading, with only 47% of boys compared to 60% of girls said they read for pleasure. One in three children reported having trouble finding something interesting to read.[33]The aforementioned Nielsen Book survey found that the share of British households with at least one electronic tablet rose from 24% to 50% between 2012 and 2013.[108] According to a 2020 Childwise report based on interviews with 2,200 British children between the ages of five and sixteen, young people today are highly dependent on their mobile phones. Most now get their first device at the age of seven. By the age of eleven, having a cell phone became almost universal. Among those aged seven to sixteen, the average time spent on the phone each day is three and a third hours. 57% said they went to bed with their phones beside them and 44% told the interviewers they felt \"uncomfortable\" in the absence of their phones. Due to the nature of this technology\u2014cell phones are personal and private devices\u2014it can be difficult for parents to monitor their children's activities and shield them from inappropriate content.[109]Median age by country in years in 2017. The youth bulge is evident in parts of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.Population pyramid of the World in 2018.Although many countries have aging populations and declining birth rates, Generation Z is currently the largest generation on Earth.[110] Bloomberg's analysis of United Nations data predicted that, in 2019, members of Generation Z accounted for 2.47 billion (32%) of the 7.7 billion inhabitants of Earth, surpassing the Millennial population of 2.43 billion. The generational cutoff of Generation Z and Millennials for this analysis was placed at 2000 to 2001.[111][112]Generation Z currently comprises the majority of the population of Africa.[113] In 2017, 60% of the 1.2 billion people living in Africa fell below the age of 25.[114]In 2019, 46% of the South African population, or 27.5 million people, are members of Generation Z.[115]Statistical projections from the United Nations in 2019 suggest that, in 2020, the people of Niger had a median age of 15.2, Mali 16.3, Chad 16.6, Somalia, Uganda, and Angola all 16.7, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 17.0, Burundi 17.3, Mozambique and Zambia both 17.6. This means that more than half of their populations were born in the first two decades of the 21st century. These are the world's youngest countries by median age.[116]According to a 2020 McKinsey & Company analysis, Generation Z (defined as born from 1996 to 2012) will account for a quarter of the population of the Asia-Pacific region by 2025.[117]As a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender population imbalances in China and India. According to the United Nations, in 2018, there were 112 Chinese males for every hundred females ages 15 to 29; in India, there were 111 males for every hundred females in that age group. China had a total of 34 million excess males and India 37 million, more than the entire population of Malaysia. Together, China and India had a combined 50 million excess males under the age of 20. Such a discrepancy fuels loneliness epidemics, human trafficking (from elsewhere in Asia, such as Cambodia and Vietnam), and prostitution, among other societal problems.[118]Out of the approximately 66.8 million people of the UK in 2019, there were approximately 12.6 million people (18.8%) in Generation Z, if defined as those born from 1997 to 2012.[119]Generation Z is the most diverse generation in the European Union in regards to national origin.[120] In Europe generally, 13.9% of those ages 14 and younger in 2019 (which includes older Generation Alpha) were born in another EU Member State, and 6.6% were born outside the EU. In Luxembourg, 20.5% were born in another country, largely within the EU (6.6% outside the EU compared to 13.9% in another member state); in Ireland, 12.0% were born in another country; in Sweden, 9.4% were born in another country, largely outside the EU (7.8% outside the EU compared to 1.6% in another member state). In Finland, 4.4% of people aged 14 and younger were born abroad and 10.1% had a foreign-background in 2020.[121] However, Gen Z from eastern Europe is much more homogenous: in Croatia, only 0.7% of those aged 14 and younger were foreign-born; in Czechia, 1.1% aged 14 and younger were foreign-born.[120]Higher portions of those ages 15 to 29 in 2019 (which includes younger Millennials) were foreign born in Europe. Luxembourg had the highest share of young people (41.9%) born in a foreign country. More than 20% of this age group were foreign-born in Cyprus, Malta, Austria and Sweden. The highest shares of non-EU born young adults were found in Sweden, Spain and Luxemburg. Like with those under age 14, countries in eastern Europe generally have much smaller populations of foreign-born young adults. Poland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Latvia had the lowest shares of foreign-born young people, at 1.4 to 2.5% of the total age group.[120]Data from Statistics Canada published in 2017 showed that Generation Z comprised 17.6% of the Canadian population.[122]A report by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution stated that in the United States, the Millennials are a bridge between the largely white pre-Millennials (Generation X and their predecessors) and the more diverse post-Millennials (Generation Z and their successors).[123] Frey's analysis of U.S. Census data suggests that as of 2019, 50.9% of Generation Z is white, 13.8% is black, 25.0% Hispanic, and 5.3% Asian.[124] 29% of Generation Z are children of immigrants or immigrants themselves, compared to 23% of Millennials when they were at the same age.[125]Members of Generation Z are slightly less likely to be foreign-born than Millennials;[126] the fact that more American Latinos were born in the U.S. rather than abroad plays a role in making the first wave of Generation Z appear better educated than their predecessors. However, researchers warn that this trend could be altered by changing immigration patterns and the younger members of Generation Z choosing alternate educational paths.[127] As a demographic cohort, Generation Z is smaller than the Baby Boomers and their children, the Millennials.[128] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Generation Z makes up about one quarter of the U.S. population, as of 2015.[129] There was an 'echo boom' in the 2000s, which certainly increased the absolute number of future young adults, but did not significantly change the relative sizes of this cohort compared to their parents.[130]According to a 2022 Gallup survey, 20.8%, or about one in five, members of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ+[131]Since the mid-20th century, enrollment rates in primary schools has increased significantly in developing countries.[132] In 2019, the OECD completed a study showing that while education spending was up 15% over the previous decade, academic performance had stagnated. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study organization showed that the highest-scoring students in mathematics came from Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. In science, the highest-scoring countries were Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Russia, and Hong Kong.[41]Data from the British National Health Service (NHS) showed that between 1999 and 2017, the number of children below the age of 16 experiencing at least one mental disorder increased from 11.4% to 13.6%. The researcher interviewed older adolescents (aged 17\u201319) for the first time in 2017 and found that girls were two-thirds more likely than younger girls and twice more likely than boys from the same age group to have a mental disorder. In England, hospitalizations for self-harm doubled among teenage girls between 1997 and 2018, but there was no parallel development among boys. While the number of children receiving medical attention for mental health problems has clearly gone up, this is not necessarily an epidemic as the number of self-reports went up even faster possibly due to the diminution of stigma. Furthermore, doctors are more likely than before to diagnose a case of self-harm when previously they only treated the physical injuries.[27]A 2020 meta-analysis found that the most common psychiatric disorders among adolescents were ADHD, anxiety disorders, behavioral disorders, and depression, consistent with a previous one from 2015.[31]A 2021 UNICEF report stated that 13% of ten to nineteen year olds around the world had a diagnosed mental health disorder whilst suicide was the fourth most common cause of death among fifteen to nineteen year olds. It commented that \"disruption to routines, education, recreation, as well as concern for family income, health and increase in stress and anxiety, [caused by the COVID-19 pandemic] is leaving many children and young people feeling afraid, angry and concerned for their future.\" It also noted that the pandemic had widely disrupted mental health services.[133]Sleep deprivation is on the rise among contemporary youths,[134][28] thanks to a combination of poor sleep hygiene (having one's sleep disrupted by noise, light, and electronic devices), caffeine intake, beds that are too warm, a mismatch between biologically preferred sleep schedules at around puberty and social demands, insomnia, growing homework load, and having too many extracurricular activities.[28][29] Consequences of sleep deprivation include low mood, worse emotional regulation, anxiety, depression, increased likelihood of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and impaired cognitive functioning.[28][29] In addition, teenagers and young adults who prefer to stay up late tend to have high levels of anxiety, impulsivity, alcohol intake, and tobacco smoking.[135]A study by Glasgow University found that the number of schoolchildren in Scotland reporting sleep difficulties increased from 23% in 2014 to 30% in 2018. 37% of teenagers were deemed to have low mood (33% males and 41% females), and 14% were at risk of depression (11% males and 17% females). Older girls faced high pressure from schoolwork, friendships, family, career preparation, maintaining a good body image and good health.[136]In Canada, teenagers sleep on average between 6.5 and 7.5 hours each night, much less than what the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends, 10 hours.[137] According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, only one out of five children who needed mental health services received it. In Ontario, for instance, the number of teenagers getting medical treatment for self-harm doubled in 2019 compared to ten years prior. The number of suicides has also gone up. Various factors that increased youth anxiety and depression include over-parenting, perfectionism (especially with regards to schoolwork), social isolation, social-media use, financial problems, housing worries, and concern over some global issues such as climate change.[138]A 2010 meta-analysis by an international team of mental health experts found that the worldwide prevalence of intellectual disability (ID) was around one percent. But the share of individuals with such a condition in low- to middle-income countries were up to twice as high as their wealthier counterparts because they lacked the sources needed to tackle the problem, such as preventing children from being born with ID due to hereditary conditions with antenatal genetic screening, poor child and maternal care facilities, and inadequate nutrition, leading to, for instance, iodine deficiency. The researchers also found that ID was more common among children and adolescents than adults.[30] A 2020 literature review and meta-analysis confirmed that the incidence of ID was indeed more common than estimates from the early 2000s.[31]In 2013, a team of neuroscientists from the University College London published a paper on how neurodevelopmental disorders can affect a child's educational outcome. They found that up to 10% of the human population have specific learning disabilities or about two to three children in a (Western) classroom. Such conditions include dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder. They are caused by abnormal brain development due to complicated environmental and genetic factors. A child may have multiple learning disorders at the same time. For example, among children with ADHD, 33-45% also have dyslexia and 11% have dyscalculia. Normal or high levels of intelligence offer no protection. Each child has a unique cognitive and genetic profile and would benefit from a flexible education system.[139][140]A 2017 study from the Dominican Republic suggests that students from all sectors of the educational system utilize the Internet for academic purposes, yet those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to rank the lowest in terms of reading comprehension skills.[141]A 2020 report by psychologist John Protzko analyzed over 30 studies and found that children have become better at delaying gratification over the previous 50 years, corresponding to an average increase of 0.18 standard deviations per decade on the IQ scale. This is contrary to the opinion of the majority of the 260 cognitive experts polled (84%), who thought this ability was deteriorating. Researchers test this ability using the Marshmallow Test. Children are offered treats: if they are willing to wait, they get two; if not, they only get one. The ability to delay gratification is associated with positive life outcomes, such as better academic performance, lower rates of substance use, and healthier body weights. Possible reasons for improvements in the delaying gratification include higher standards of living, better-educated parents, improved nutrition, higher preschool attendance rates, more test awareness, and environmental or genetic changes. This development does not mean that children from the early 20th century were worse at delaying gratification and those from the late 21st will be better at it, however. Moreover, some other cognitive abilities, such as simple reaction time, color acuity, working memory, the complexity of vocabulary usage, and three-dimensional visuospatial reasoning have shown signs of secular decline.[15]In a 2018 paper, cognitive scientists James R. Flynn and Michael Shayer argued that the observed gains in IQ during the 20th century\u2014commonly known as the Flynn effect\u2014had either stagnated or reversed, as can be seen from a combination of IQ and Piagetian tests. In the Nordic nations, there was a clear decline in general intelligence starting in the 1990s, an average of 6.85 IQ points if projected over 30 years. In Australia and France, the data remained ambiguous; more research was needed. In the United Kingdom, young children experienced a decline in the ability to perceive weight and heaviness, with heavy losses among top scorers. In German-speaking countries, young people saw a fall in spatial reasoning ability but an increase in verbal reasoning skills. In the Netherlands, preschoolers and perhaps schoolchildren stagnated (but seniors gained) in cognitive skills. What this means is that people were gradually moving away from abstraction to concrete thought. On the other hand, the United States continued its historic march towards higher IQ, a rate of 0.38 per decade, at least up until 2014. South Korea saw its IQ scores growing at twice the average U.S. rate. The secular decline of cognitive abilities observed in many developed countries might be caused by diminishing marginal returns due to industrialization and to intellectually stimulating environments for preschoolers, the cultural shifts that led to frequent use of electronic devices, the fall in cognitively demanding tasks in the job market in contrast to the 20th century, and possibly dysgenic fertility.[142]Multidisciplinary research in the early 21st century suggests that ongoing human evolution could help explain the rise of certain medical conditions such as autism and autoimmune disorders among children. Autism and schizophrenia may be due to genes inherited from the mother and the father that are over-expressed and that fight a tug-of-war in the child's body. Allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disorders appear linked to higher standards of sanitation, which prevent the immune systems of modern humans from being exposed to various parasites and pathogens the way their ancestors' were, making them hypersensitive and more likely to overreact. The human body is not built from a professionally engineered blueprint, but rather is a system shaped over long periods of time by evolution with all kinds of trade-offs and imperfections. Understanding the evolution of the human body can help medical doctors better understand and treat various disorders. Research in evolutionary medicine suggests that diseases are prevalent because natural selection favors reproduction over health and longevity. In addition, biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.[143]A 2015 study found that the frequency of nearsightedness has doubled in the United Kingdom within the last 50 years. Ophthalmologist Steve Schallhorn, chairman of the Optical Express International Medical Advisory Board, noted that research has pointed to a link between the regular use of handheld electronic devices and eyestrain. The American Optometric Association sounded the alarm in a similar vein.[144] According to a spokeswoman, digital eyestrain, or computer vision syndrome, is \"rampant, especially as we move toward smaller devices and the prominence of devices increase in our everyday lives.\" Symptoms include dry and irritated eyes, fatigue, eye strain, blurry vision, difficulty focusing, headaches. However, the syndrome does not cause vision loss or any other permanent damage. To alleviate or prevent eyestrain, the Vision Council recommends that people limit screen time, take frequent breaks, adjust the screen brightness, change the background from bright colors to gray, increase text sizes, and blinking more often. Parents should not only limit their children's screen time but should also lead by example.[145]While food allergies have been observed by doctors since ancient times and virtually all foods can be allergens, research by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota found they are becoming increasingly common since the early 2000s. Today, one in twelve American children has a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent type. Reasons for this remain poorly understood.[24] Nut allergies in general have quadrupled and shellfish allergies have increased 40% between 2004 and 2019. In all, about 36% of American children have some kind of allergy. By comparison, this number among the Amish in Indiana is 7%. Allergies have also risen ominously in other Western countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the number of children hospitalized for allergic reactions increased by a factor of five between 1990 and the late 2010s, as did the number of British children allergic to peanuts. In general, the better developed the country, the higher the rates of allergies.[25] Reasons for this remain poorly understood.[24] One possible explanation, supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is that parents keep their children \"too clean for their own good\". They recommend exposing newborn babies to a variety of potentially allergenic foods, such as peanut butter before they reach the age of six months. According to this \"hygiene hypothesis\", such exposures give the infant's immune system some exercise, making it less likely to overreact. Evidence for this includes the fact that children living on a farm are consistently less likely to be allergic than their counterparts who are raised in the city, and that children born in a developed country to parents who immigrated from developing nations are more likely to be allergic than their parents are.[25]A research article published in 2019 in the journal The Lancet reported that the number of South Africans aged 15 to 19 being treated for HIV increased by a factor of ten between 2010 and 2019.  This is partly due to improved detection and treatment programs. However, less than 50% of the people diagnosed with HIV went onto receive antiviral medication due to social stigma, concerns about clinical confidentiality, and domestic responsibilities. While the annual number of deaths worldwide due to HIV/AIDS has declined from its peak in the early 2000s, experts warned that this venereal disease could rebound if the world's booming adolescent population is left unprotected.[146]Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that 46% of Australians aged 18 to 24, about a million people, were overweight in 2017 and 2018. That number was 39% in 2014 and 2015. Obese individuals face higher risks of type II diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and stroke. The Australian Medical Associated and Obesity Coalition have urged the federal government to levy a tax on sugary drinks, to require health ratings, and to regulate the advertisement of fast foods. In all, the number of Australian adults who are overweight or obese rose from 63% in 2014\u201315 to 67% in 2017\u201318.[147]In Europe and the United States, the average age of the onset of puberty among girls was around 13 in the early 21st century, down from about 16 a hundred years earlier. Early puberty is associated with a variety of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression (as people at this age tend to strongly desire conformity with their peers), early sexual activity, substance use, tobacco smoking, eating disorders, and disruptive behavioral disorders.[19] Girls who mature early also face higher risks of sexual harassment. Moreover, in some cultures, pubertal onset remains a marker of readiness for marriage, for, in their point of view, a girl who shows signs of puberty might engage in sexual intercourse or risks being assaulted, and marrying her off is how she might be 'protected'.[21] To compound matters, factors known for prompting mental health problems are themselves linked to early pubertal onset; these are early childhood stress, absent fathers, domestic conflict, and low socioeconomic status. Possible causes of early puberty could be positive, namely improved nutrition, or negative, such as obesity and stress.[19] Other triggers include genetic factors, high body-mass index (BMI), exposure to endocrine-disrupting substances that remain in use, such as Bisphenol A (found in some plastics) and dichlorobenzene (used in mothballs and air deodorants), and to banned but persistent chemicals, such as dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and perhaps a combination thereof (the 'cocktail effect').[20][148]A 2019 meta-analysis and review of the research literature from all inhabited continents found that between 1977 and 2013, the age of pubertal onset among girls has fallen by an average of almost three months per decade, but with significant regional variations, ranging from 10.1 to 13.2 years in Africa to 8.8 to 10.3 years in the United States. This investigation relies on measurements of thelarche (initiation of breast tissue development) using the Tanner scale rather than self-reported menarche (first menstruation) and MRI brain scans for signs of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis being reactivated.[20] Furthermore, there is evidence that sexual maturity and psychosocial maturity no longer coincide; 21st-century youth appears to be reaching the former before the latter. Neither adolescents nor societies are prepared for this mismatch.[22][23][note 1]In the late 2010s, in tandem with more members of Generation Z being able to vote in elections, the youth vote has increased.[149][150] Generation Z tends to be more progressive than its predecessors, and exhibits many trends seen with Millennials, such as its trend towards left-wing progressivism (particularly in the US and UK).[151]\nMembers of Generation Z in G20 countries prefer a nationalist to a globalist approach to public policy by a clear margin: 51% to 32%.[152] In some European democracies, such as France, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40.[153] Generation Z is more likely than other generations to believe that climate change is real and to support climate change mitigation.[154][155] Gen Z were most likely to support the Greens or Free Democratic Party in Germany, the Labour Party in the UK and the Democrats in the US in recent elections. The age divide between left-wing and right-wing has particularly grown in the last decade.One of the earliest political movements primarily driven by Generation Z was School Strike for Climate in the late 2010s. The movement saw millions of young people around the world, inspired by the activities of Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, protest for greater action on climate change.[156][157]A 2016 survey by Varkey Foundation and Populus conducted on 20,000 people aged 15 to 21 from twenty countries from all inhabited continents revealed that religious faith was influential to 42% of the respondents and inconsequential to 39%. There was, however, a clear difference between the age subgroups, with people 15-16 slightly more likely to value religion as important than those aged 19\u201321 (47% vs. 43%). Nevertheless, for 53%, religion influenced the values they hold. In order to further determine the role of religion in young people's lives, the pollsters asked them (1) whether or not it was important to them personally, (2) to their parents, (3) whether their parents' religion determined whom they would marry, and (4) if religion helps them decide whether to be friends with someone. Overall, religion was important to 11% of respondents. But there was a large gap among countries with Nigeria at one end (32%) and Germany and Japan at the other (3%). (See above.)[84]The 2016 British Social Attitudes Survey found that 71% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 had no religion, compared to 62% the year before. A 2018 ComRes survey found that slightly more than one in two of those aged 18 to 24 reported a positive experience with Christians and Christianity. Two-thirds of the same age group have never attended church; among the remaining third, 20% went a few times a year, and 2% multiple times per week. 12% of respondents aged 18 to 24 agreed with the claim that Christians were a bad influence on society, compared to just over half who disagreed. For comparison, 14% of those aged 25 to 34 agreed. In all, 51% of Britons disagreed with the same while 10% agreed. Results from the 2018 ComRes survey were released a day after the Church of England announced it was going to establish more than a hundred churches, mainly in urban areas, to attract new followers.[158]Globally, religion is in decline in the Euro-American countries but is growing in the rest of the world.[159] Although the number of atheists, agnostics, and people not affiliated with organized religion continues to grow in Europe and the United States, their percentage of the world population is falling because of their comparatively low fertility rate (1.7).[160] In general, the growth or decline of a given religion is due more to age and fertility rather than conversion.[159][161] Besides the level of education and income, how religious a woman is determines how many children she will bear in her lifetime. For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century.[161] According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025. In addition, the Catholic Church has gained 12% additional followers between 2000 and 2010, mainly from Asia and Africa.[161] In 2018, Muslims had a median age of 23, Hindus 26, Christians 30, Buddhists and the religiously unaffiliated 34, and Jews 36. For comparison, the median age of the global population was 28 in 2018. Overall, Christians have a fertility rate of 2.6, and Muslims 2.9. Islam is the world's fastest-growing religion.[159] Meanwhile, the expansion of secularism will slow in Europe as the 21st century progresses.[161]But religion can grow even in otherwise secular societies.[161] For example, in Israel, the ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just about five percent of the nation's primary schoolchildren in 1960, but by the start of the 21st century, one-third of Jewish first graders in Israel came from this religious sect.[162] Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women in Israel had on average 7.5 children compared to their more mainstream counterparts with just over two in the early 2000s.[161] In Europe, immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77.[161] In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists,[161] who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s.[162] In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the 21st century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization.[161] Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three-quarters of Jewish births at the start of the 21st century. (This group is projected to make up the majority of Anglo-American Jews by 2050.)[162] In the United States, Catholicism will become the largest religion by 2040 despite considerable losses to secularization and conversion to Protestantism thanks in no small part to the fact that Latino Catholics had a fertility rate of 2.83 compared to the national average of 2.03 in 2003. Such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.[161]American adolescents maintained their abstinence from alcohol and sexual intercourse through early adulthood.[9] More broadly, adolescent pregnancy was in decline during the early 21st century all across the industrialized world, due to the widespread availability of contraception and the growing avoidance of sexual intercourse among teenagers. In New Zealand, the pregnancy rate for females aged 15 to 19 dropped from 33 per 1,000 in 2008 to 16 in 2016. Highly urbanized regions had adolescent pregnancy rates well below the national average whereas Maori communities had much higher than average rates. In Australia, it was 15 per 1,000 in 2015.[163]2020 data from the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on a per-capita basis, members of Generation Z binged on alcohol 20% less often than Millennials. However, 9.9% of people aged 16 to 24 consumed at least one drug in the past month, usually cannabis, or more than twice the share of the population between the ages of 16 and 59. \"Cannabis has now\u00a0taken over from the opiates in terms of the most people in treatment for addiction,\" psychopharmacologist Val Curran of the University College London (UCL) told The Telegraph. Moreover, the quality and affordability of various addictive drugs have improved in recent years, making them an appealing alternative to alcoholic beverages for many young people, who now have the ability to arrange a meeting with a deal via social media. Addiction psychiatrist Adam Winstock of UCL found using his Global Drug Survey that young people rated cocaine more highly than alcohol on the basis of value for money, 4.8 compared to 4.7 out of 10.[14]As of 2019, cannabis was legal for both medical and recreational use in Uruguay, Canada, and 33 states in the US.[164] In the United States, Generation Z is the first to be born into a time when the legalization of marijuana at the federal level is being seriously considered.[165] While adolescents (people aged 12 to 17) in the late 2010s were more likely to avoid both alcohol and marijuana compared to their predecessors from 20 years before, college-aged youths are more likely than their elders to consume marijuana.[13] Shortly before the full legalization of marijuana, the Government of Canada commissioned a study from health-policy analyst Fiona Clement and her colleagues at the University of Calgary in order to guide their regulations of the substance. After surveying the literature, Clement and her team found that pregnant women, teenagers, and people prone to mental illnesses are especially vulnerable to the negative effects of marijuana usage, including, among other things, impaired driving, higher risks of stroke, testicular cancer, memory loss, and certain mental illnesses, such as psychosis. Compared to those who do not use cannabis or those who start after they reach 16 years, people who start before that age experience reduced cognitive functioning (including planning and decision-making skills), and higher levels of impulsivity.[164] According to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, heavy use of marijuana is linked to low life satisfaction, mental health issues, and relationship problems; second-hand smoke could harm children and people with asthma. Heavy use is also correlated with schizophrenia, but a causal link has not been established. About one in ten marijuana users developed a substance use disorder, meaning they continue to use it even though it causes problems in their lives, and those who use it before the age of 18 are more likely to develop it.[166] A 2016 analysis of two longitudinal studies of twins (\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n1\n\n\n=\n789\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{1}=789}\n\u00a0 and \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n=\n2\n,\n277\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{2}=2,277}\n\u00a0) reveals a noticeable decline in crystallized intelligence between pre-adolescence and late adolescence among marijuana smokers but no significant effects on IQ, as those can be attributed to other factors, namely genetics and familial environments conducive to low intellectual achievement and marijuana use initiation.[167]During the 2010s, when most of Generation Z experienced some or all of their adolescence, reductions in youth crime were seen in some Western countries. A report looking at statistics from 2018 to 2019 noted that the numbers of young people aged ten to seventeen in England and Wales being cautioned or sentenced for criminal activity had fallen by 83% over the previous decade, while those entering the youth justice system for the first time had fallen by 85%.[168] In 2006, 3,000 youths in England and Wales were detained for criminal activity; ten years later, that number fell below 1,000.[9] In Europe, teenagers were less likely to fight than before.[9] Research from Australia suggested that crime rates among adolescents had consistently declined between 2010 and 2019.[169] In a 2014 report, Statistics Canada stated that police-reported crimes committed by persons between the ages of 12 and 17 had been falling steadily since 2006 as part of a larger trend of decline from a peak in 1991. Between 2000 and 2014, youth crimes plummeted 42%, above the drop for overall crime of 34%. In fact, between the late 2000s and mid-2010s, the fall was especially rapid. This was primarily driven by a 51% drop in theft of items worth no more than CAN$5,000 and burglary. The most common types of crime committed by Canadian adolescents were theft and violence. At school, the most frequent offenses were possession of cannabis, common assault, and uttering threats. Overall, although they made up only 7% of the population, adolescents stood accused of 13% of all crimes in Canada. In addition, mid- to late-teens were more likely to be accused of crimes than any other age group in the country.[170]A 2020 report by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC)\u2014available only by request due to the presence of graphic materials\u2014suggests that parents are either in denial or are completely oblivious to the prevalence of pornography viewership by adolescents, with three quarters telling researchers they do not believe their children consumed such materials. Meanwhile, teenagers are increasingly turning to pornography as a source of information on sexuality, especially what to do during a sexual encounter, as teachers tend to focus on contraception. Over half of the teenagers interviewed told researchers they had viewed pornography, though the actual number might be higher due to the sensitivity of this topic. While parents generally believe adolescents who view pornography for pleasure tend to be boys, surveys and interviews reveal that this behavior is also common among girls. Most teenagers encounter pornography on a dedicated website, but an increasing number watch it on social media platforms such as Snapchat and WhatsApp. Many told researchers they felt anxious about their body image and the expectations of their potential sexual partners as a result of viewing, and their concerns over violent behavior. About one-third of the U.K. population watches these films, according to industry estimates. This report came as part of an ill-fated attempt by the U.K. government to introduce age verification to pornographic websites.[171]Sociologists Judith Treas and Giulia M. Dotti Sani analyzed the diaries of 122,271 parents (68,532 mothers, 53,739 fathers) aged 18 to 65 in households with at least one child below the age of 13 from 1965 to 2012 in eleven Western countries\u2014Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Slovenia\u2014and discovered that in general, parents had been spending more and more time with their children. In 1965, a mother spent on average 54 minutes on childcare activities each day whereas one from 2012 spent almost twice as much 104 minutes. Among fathers, the amount of time spent on childcare roughly quadrupled, from 16 minutes in 1965 to 59 in 2012. Parents of all education levels were represented, though those with higher education typically spent much more time with their children, especially university-educated mothers. France was the only exception. French mothers were spending less time with their children whereas fathers were spending more time. This overall trend reflected the dominant ideology of \"intensive parenting\" the idea that the time parents spend with children is crucial for their development in various areas and the fact that fathers developed more egalitarian views with regards to gender roles over time and became more likely to want to play an active role in their children's lives.[172]In the United Kingdom, there was a widespread belief in the early 21st century that rising parental, societal and state concern for the safety of children was leaving them increasingly mollycoddled and slowing the pace they took on responsibilities.[173][174][175] The same period saw a rise in child-rearing's position in the public discourse with parenting manuals and reality TV programs focused on family life, such as Supernanny, providing specific guidelines for how children should be cared for and disciplined.[176]According to Statistics Canada, the number of households with both grandparents and grandchildren remained rare but grew in the early 21st century. In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in the early 21st century couldn't (or believe they couldn't) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggled to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Because Millennials and members of Generation X tend to have fewer children than their parents the Baby Boomers, each child typically receives more attention from his or her grandparents and parents compared to previous generations.[177]According to the OECD PISA surveys, 15-year-olds in 2015 had a tougher time making friends at school than ten years prior. European teenagers were becoming more and more like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts in social isolation. This might be due to intrusive parenting, heavy use of electronic devices, and concerns over academic performance and job prospects.[9]A study of social interaction among American teenagers found that the amount of time young people spent with their friends had been trending downwards since the 1970s but fallen into especially sharp decline after 2010. The percentage of students in the 12th grade (typically 17 to 18 years old) who said they met with their friends almost every day fell from 52% in 1976 to 28% in 2017. The percentage of that age group who said they often felt lonely (which had fallen during the early 2000s) increased from 26% in 2012 to 39% in 2017 whilst the percentage who often felt left out increased from 30% to 38% over the same period. Statistics for slightly younger teenagers suggested that parties had become significantly less common since the 1980s.[178]According to a 2014 report from UNICEF, some 250 million females were forced into marriage before the age of 15, especially in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Problems faced by child brides include loss of educational opportunity, less access to medical care, higher childbirth mortality rates, depression, and suicidal ideation.[21][179]In Australia, it was reported in 2017 that growing numbers of older teenage boys and young men were avoiding romantic relationships altogether, citing concerns over the traumatic experiences of older male family members, including false accusations of sexual misconduct or loss of assets and money after a divorce. This social trend\u2014Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW)\u2014is an outgrowth of the men's rights movement, but one that emphasizes detachment from women as a way to deal with the issues men face. \"Both sexes have different challenges; we've lost sight of that. We're stuck in a gender war and it's harming our children,\" psychologist Meredith Fuller told News.com.au.[180]In China, young people nowadays are much more likely to deem marriage and children sources of stress rather than fulfillment, going against the Central Government's attempts to increase the birth rate. Women born between the mid-1990s to about 2010 are less interested in getting married than men their own age. As a result of the one-child policy, young Chinese women have become more educated and financially independent than ever before, and this has led to a shift in public attitudes towards career-oriented women. The \"lying flat\" movement, popular among Chinese youths, also extends to the domain of marriage and child-rearing.[181]In line with a fall in adolescent pregnancy in the developed world, which is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this article, there has also been a reduction in the percentage of the youngest adults with children. The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of babies being born in the United Kingdom to 18 year old mothers had fallen by 58% from 2000 to 2016 and the amount being born to 18 year old fathers had fallen by 41% over the same period.[182] Pew Research reports that in 2016, 88% of American women aged 18 to 21 were childless as opposed to 80% of Generation X and 79% of millennial female youth at a similar age.[183]A 2020 survey conducted by PensionBee in the United Kingdom found that about 10% of non-parents aged 18 to 23 were considering not having children in order to be able to retire earlier. Those in the arts and those in the income bracket \u00a325,001 to \u00a355,000 were most likely to say no to having children.[184]Generation Z is one of the first cohorts to have Internet technology readily available at a young age.[185] With the Web 2.0 revolution that occurred throughout the mid-late 2000s and 2010s, they have been exposed to an unprecedented amount of technology in their upbringing, with the use of mobile devices growing exponentially over time. Anthony Turner characterizes Generation Z as having a \"digital bond to the Internet\", and argues that it may help youth to escape from emotional and mental struggles they face offline.[4]According to U.S. consultants Sparks and Honey in 2014, 41% of Generation Z spend more than three hours per day using computers for purposes other than schoolwork, compared with 22% in 2004.[186] In 2015, an estimated 150,000 apps, 10% of apps in Apple's App Store, were educational and aimed at children up to college level,[187] though opinions are mixed as to whether the net result will be deeper involvement in learning[187] and more individualized instruction, or impairment through greater technology dependence[188] and a lack of self-regulation that may hinder child development.[188] Parents of Gen Zers fear the overuse of the Internet, and dislike the ease of access to inappropriate information and images, as well as social networking sites where children can gain access to people worldwide. Children reversely feel annoyed with their parents and complain about parents being overly controlling when it comes to their Internet usage.[189]A 2015 study by Microsoft found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 said yes to the statement, \"When nothing is occupying my attention, the first thing I do is reach for my phone,\" compared to just 10% for those aged 65 and over.[190]In a TEDxHouston talk, Jason Dorsey of the Center for Generational Kinetics stressed the notable differences in the way that Millennials and Generation Z consume technology, with 18% of Generation Z feeling that it is okay for a 13-year-old to have a smartphone, compared with just 4% for the previous generation.[191][192][193] An online newspaper about texting, SMS and MMS writes that teens own cellphones without necessarily needing them; that receiving a phone is considered a rite of passage in some countries, allowing the owner to be further connected with their peers, and it is now a social norm to have one at an early age.[194] An article from the Pew Research Center stated that \"nearly three-quarters of teens have or have access to a smartphone and 30% have a basic phone, while just 12% of teens 13 to 15 say they have no cell phone of any type\".[195] These numbers are only on the rise and the fact that the majority own a cell phone has become one of this generation's defining characteristics. Consequently, \"24% of teens go online 'almost constantly'.\"[195]A survey of students from 79 countries by the OECD found that the amount of time spent using an electronic device has increased, from under two hours per weekday in 2012 to close to three in 2019, at the expense of extracurricular reading.[32]Psychologists have observed that sexting\u2014or the transmission of sexually explicit content via electronic devices\u2014has seen noticeable growth among contemporary adolescents. Older teenagers are more likely to participate in sexting. Besides some cultural and social factors such as the desire for acceptance and popularity among peers, the falling age at which a child receives a smartphone may contribute to the growth in this activity. However, while it is clear that sexting has an emotional impact on adolescents, it is still not clear how it precisely affects them. Some consider it a high-risk behavior because of the ease of dissemination to third parties leading to reputational damage and the link to various psychological conditions including depression and even suicidal ideation. Others defend youths' freedom of expression over the Internet. In any case, there is some evidence that at least in the short run, sexting brings positive feelings of liveliness or satisfaction. However, girls are more likely than boys to be receiving insults, social rejections, or reputational damage as a result of sexting.[16]Despite being labeled as 'digital natives', the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), conducted on 42,000 eighth-graders (or equivalents) from 14 countries and education systems, found that only two percent of these people were sufficiently proficient with information devices to justify that description, and only 19% could work independently with computers to gather information and to manage their work.[6] ICILS assesses students on two main categories: Computer and Information Literacy (CIL), and Computational Thinking (CT). For CIL, there are four levels, one to four, with Level 4 being the highest. Although at least 80% of students from most countries tested reached Level 1, only two percent on average reached Level 4. Countries or education systems whose students scored near or above the international average of 496 in CIL were, in increasing order, France, North Rhine-Westphalia, Portugal, Germany, the United States, Finland, South Korea, Moscow, and Denmark. CT is divided into four levels, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Regions. International averages for the proportions of students reaching each of these were 18%, 50%, and 32%, respectively. Countries or education systems whose students scored near or above the international average of 500 were, in increasing order, the United States, France, Finland, Denmark, and South Korea. In general, female eighth-graders outperformed their male counterparts in CIL by an international average of 18 points but were narrowly outclassed by their male counterparts in CT. (Narrow gaps made estimates of averages have higher coefficients of variation.)[196] In the United States, where the computer-based tests were administered by the National Center for Education Statistics,[6] 72% of eighth-graders said they searched for information on the Internet at least once a week or every school day, and 65% reported they were autodidactic information finders on the Internet.[196]The use of social media has become integrated into the daily lives of most Gen Zers with access to mobile technology, who use it primarily to keep in contact with friends and family. As a result, mobile technology has caused online relationship development to become a new generational norm.[197] Gen Z uses social media and other sites to strengthen bonds with friends and to develop new ones. They interact with people who they otherwise would not have met in the real world, becoming a tool for identity creation.[189] The negative side to mobile devices for Generation Z, according to Twenge, is they are less \"face to face\", and thus feel more lonely and left out.[198]Focus group testing found that while teens may be annoyed by many aspects of Facebook, they continue to use it because participation is important in terms of socializing with friends and peers. Twitter and Instagram are seen to be gaining popularity among members of Generation Z, with 24% (and growing) of teens with access to the Internet having Twitter accounts.[199] This is, in part, due to parents not typically using these social networking sites.[199] Snapchat is also seen to have gained attraction in Generation Z because videos, pictures, and messages send much faster on it than in regular messaging. TikTok has gained increasing popularity among Gen Z users, surpassing Instagram in 2021.[200] Speed and reliability are important factors in members of Generation Z's choice of social networking platform. This need for quick communication is presented in popular Generation Z apps like Vine and the prevalent use of emojis.[201]A study by Gabrielle Borca, et al found that teenagers in 2012 were more likely to share different types of information than teenagers in 2006.[199] However, they will take steps to protect information that they do not want being shared, and are more likely to \"follow\" others on social media than \"share\".[202] A survey of U.S. teenagers from advertising agency J. Walter Thomson likewise found that the majority of teenagers are concerned about how their posting will be perceived by people or their friends. 72% of respondents said they were using social media on a daily basis, and 82% said they thought carefully about what they post on social media. Moreover, 43% said they had regrets about previous posts.[203]A 2019 Childwise survey of 2,000 British children aged five to sixteen found that the popularity Facebook halved compared to the previous year. Children of the older age group, fifteen to sixteen, reported signs of online fatigue, with about three of ten saying they wanted to spend less time on the Internet.[96]In his 2017 book Irresistible, professor of marketing Adam Alter explained that not only are children addicted to electronic gadgets, but their addiction jeopardizes their ability to read non-verbal social cues.[204]A 2019 meta-analysis of thousands of studies from almost two dozen countries suggests that while as a whole, there is no association between screen time and academic performance, when the relation between individual screen-time activity and academic performance is examined, negative associations are found. Watching television is negatively correlated with overall school grades, language fluency, and mathematical ability while playing video games was negatively associated with overall school grades only. According to previous research, screen activities not only take away the time that could be spent on homework, physical activities, verbal communication, and sleep (the time-displacement hypothesis) but also diminish mental activities (the passivity hypothesis). Furthermore, excessive television viewing is known for harming the ability to pay attention as well as other cognitive functions; it also causes behavioral disorders, such as having unhealthy diets, which could damage academic performance. Excessive video gaming, on the other hand, is known for impairing social skills and mental health, and as such could also damage academic performance. However, depending on the nature of the game, playing it could be beneficial for the child; for instance, the child could be motivated to learn the language of the game in order to play it better. Among adolescents, excessive Internet surfing is well known for being negatively associated with school grades, though previous research does not distinguish between the various devices used. Nevertheless, one study indicates that Internet access, if used for schoolwork, is positively associated with school grades but if used for leisure, is negatively associated with it. Overall, the effects of screen time are stronger among adolescents than children.[7]Research conducted in 2017 reports that the social media usage patterns of this generation may be associated with loneliness, anxiety, and fragility and that girls may be more affected than boys by social media. According to 2018 CDC reports, girls are disproportionately affected by the negative aspects of social media than boys.[205] Researchers at the University of Essex analyzed data from 10,000 families, from 2010 to 2015, assessing their mental health utilizing two perspectives: Happiness and Well-being throughout social, familial, and educational perspectives. Within each family, they examined children who had grown from 10 to 15 during these years. At age 10, 10% of female subjects reported social media use, while this was only true for 7% of the male subjects. By age 15, this variation jumped to 53% for girls, and 41% for boys. This percentage influx may explain why more girls reported experiencing cyberbullying, decreased self-esteem, and emotional instability more than their male counterparts.[206]Other researchers hypothesize that girls are more affected by social media usage because of how they use it. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, researchers discovered that while 78% of girls reported making a friend through social media, only 52% of boys could say the same.[207] However, boys are not explicitly less affected by this statistic. They also found that 57% of boys claimed to make friends through video gaming, while this was only true for 13% of girls.[207] Another Pew Research Center survey conducted in April 2015, reported that women are more likely to use Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram than men. In counterpoint, men were more likely to utilize online forums, e-chat groups, and Reddit than women.[207]Cyberbullying is more common now than among Millennials, the previous generation. It is more common among girls, 22% compared to 10% for boys. This results in young girls feeling more vulnerable to being excluded and undermined.[208][209]According to a 2020 report by the British Board of Film Classification, \"many young people felt that the way they viewed their overall body image was more likely the result of the kinds of body images they saw on Instagram.\"[171]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Clash_(magazine)": "Clash is a music and fashion magazine and website based in the United Kingdom. It is published four times a year by Music Republic Ltd,[1] whose predecessor Clash Music Ltd went into liquidation.The magazine won the Best New Magazine award in 2004 at the PPA Magazine Awards and has won other awards in England and Scotland. Most notably, it won Magazine of the Year at the 2011 Record of the Day Awards.[2]Clash was founded by John O'Rourke, Simon Harper, Iain Carnegie and Jon-Paul Kitching.[3]  It emerged from the long-running Dundee, Scotland-based free-listings magazine Vibe. Re-launching as Clash Magazine in 2004,[3] it won Best New Magazine award at the PPA Magazine Awards and Music Magazine of the Year at the Record of the Day Awards in 2005 and 2011 respectively.[4]At the turn of 2011, Clash took on an entirely new look, ditching its previous glossy feel and music-led design for an altogether more artistically-led approach. In 2013 it launched a Smartphone channel, the iOS Apple Magazine app of which went on to win 'Best Music Magazine' at the Digital Magazine Awards. In February 2014 it expanded into Android handsets.In November 2014, the magazine published its 99th edition, but then withdrew from print publication in favour of moving to an online-first operation. The Web-based service continued throughout the magazine's absence from the news-stands. In late 2015 it was announced that Clash would return to print as a bimonthly magazine from February 2016, beginning its revived run with a 100th issue special.[5]The publication draws on the larger Clash brand, which extends to live events around the country and festival partnerships/parties (such as RockNess, Snowbombing, SXSW), and the website, ClashMusic.com. 2011 saw Clash partner Levi's and Spotify to bring Primal Scream to London's Electric Brixton for one of their final shows with the former Stone Roses member, Mani.The Clash Live brand's London activity used to incorporate a once-monthly club night at The Lexington, part of their tastemaking Ones To Watch section, which has played host to acts including Swimming, Three Trapped Tigers, Alpines and Wild Palms. More recently this activity re-branded to be called 'Next Wave' in order to reflect internal changes in the magazine and now enjoys a residency at Hackney's new Oslo venue.ClashMusic.com launched in early 2008. The website often encompasses a wider variety of genres than its parent magazine, with pieces on left field acts like Gonjasufi and Perfume Genius, as well as emerging artists, appearing alongside content that ties in with magazine-featured artists. The website features numerous ongoing features such as \"DJ Disasters\", \"Rapture & Verse\" and \"A Letter From...\". It runs a Track of the Day feature from Monday to Friday.The website underwent a redesign in October 2012, bringing it in line with the look of the print magazine.On 30 March 2009, ClashMusic began publishing the Essential 50\u2014fifty albums which the website considered \"the 50 greatest, most significant, downright brilliant albums of Clash's lifetime\".[6] Made up entirely of albums released in the past five years,[7] the list was published in sections of three, with the top ten being released individually between 15\u201324 April 2009.[7][8]ClashMusic.com was nominated for Best Music Magazine and Best Podcast at the 2008 BT Digital Music Awards.[13]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Variety_(magazine)": "Variety is an American media company owned by Penske Media Corporation. The company was founded by Sime Silverman in New York City in 1905 as a weekly newspaper reporting on theater and vaudeville. In 1933 it added Daily Variety, based in Los Angeles, to cover the motion-picture industry. Variety.com features entertainment news, reviews, box office results, cover stories, videos, photo galleries and features, plus a credits database, production charts and calendar, with archive content dating back to 1905.Variety has been published since December 16, 1905,[1][2] when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and vaudeville with its headquarters in New York City. Silverman had been fired by The Morning Telegraph in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50.[3] As a result, he decided to start his own publication \"that [would] not be influenced by advertising.\"[4] With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched Variety as publisher and editor.[5] In addition to The Morning Telegraph, other major competitors on launch were The New York Clipper and the New York Dramatic Mirror.[5]The original cover design, which is very similar to the current design, was sketched by Edgar M. Miller, a scenic painter, who refused payment.[6] The front cover contained pictures of the original editorial staff, who were Alfred Greason, Epes W Sargeant (Chicot or Chic) and Joshua Lowe, as well as Silverman.[7] The first issue contained a review by Silverman's son Sidne, also known as Skigie (based on the childish lisping of his name) who was claimed to be the youngest critic in the world at seven years old.[8]In 1922 Silverman acquired The New York Clipper which had been reporting on the stage and other entertainment since 1853, in an attempt to attract advertising revenue away from Billboard, following a dispute with William Donaldson, the owner of Billboard.[9] Silverman folded it two years later after spending $100,000, merging some of its features into Variety.[10][9] The same year, he launched the Times Square Daily, which he referred to as \"the world's worst daily\" and soon scrapped.[5] During that period, Variety staffers worked on all three papers.After the launch of The Hollywood Reporter in 1930,[11] Silverman launched the Hollywood-based Daily Variety in 1933 with Arthur Ungar as the editor. It replaced Variety Bulletin that was issued in Hollywood on Fridays as a four-page wraparound to the Weekly.[9] Daily Variety was initially published every day other than Sunday but mostly on Monday to Friday.[12] The Daily and the Weekly were initially run as virtually independent newspapers, with the Daily concentrating mostly on Hollywood news and the Weekly on U.S. and international coverage.Silverman had passed on the editorship of the Weekly Variety to Abel Green as his replacement in 1933. He remained as publisher until his death later that year, soon after launching Daily Variety. Silverman's son Sidne succeeded him as publisher of both publications but upon contracting tuberculosis in 1936 he could no longer take a day to day role at the paper.[13] Green, the editor, and Harold Erichs, the treasurer and chief financial officer, ran the paper during his illness.[13] Following Sidne's death in 1950, his only son Syd Silverman, was the sole heir to what was then Variety Inc. Young Syd's legal guardian Erichs, who had started at Variety as an office boy, assumed the presidency.[13][9]Ungar remained editor of Daily Variety until his death in 1950.[14]\nHe was followed by Joe Schoenfeld.[15]In 1953 Army Archerd took over the \"Just for Variety\" column on page two of Daily Variety and swiftly became popular in Hollywood. Archerd broke countless exclusive stories, reporting from film sets, announcing pending deals, giving news of star-related hospitalizations, marriages, and births. The column appeared daily for 52 years until September 1, 2005.[16]Erichs continued to oversee Variety until 1956.[13][9] After that date, Syd Silverman managed the company as publisher of both the Weekly Variety in New York and the Daily Variety in Hollywood.Thomas M. Pryor, former Hollywood bureau chief of The New York Times, became editor of Daily Variety in 1959. Under Pryor, Daily Variety expanded from 8 pages to 32 pages and also saw circulation increase from 8,000 to 22,000.[17][18][15]Green remained as editor of Variety until his death in 1973, with Syd taking over the role.[19][20]In 1987, Variety was sold to Cahners Publishing for $64 million.[21] In December 1987, Syd handed over editorship of Variety to Roger Watkins.[20] After 29 years as editor of Daily Variety, Tom Pryor handed over to his son Pete in June 1988.[15]On December 7, 1988, Watkins proposed and oversaw the transition to four-color print. Upon its launch, the new-look Variety measured one inch shorter with a washed-out color on the front. The old front-page box advertisement was replaced by a strip advertisement, along with the first photos published in Variety since Sime gave up using them in the old format in 1920: they depicted Sime, Abel and Syd.[22]For 20 years from 1989, Variety's editor-in-chief was Peter Bart, originally only of the weekly New York edition, with Michael Silverman (Syd's son) running the Daily in Hollywood. Bart had worked previously at Paramount Pictures and The New York Times.Syd Silverman remained as publisher until 1990 when he was succeeded on Weekly Variety by Gerard A. Byrne and on Daily Variety by Sime Silverman's great grandson, Michael Silverman. Syd became chairman of both publications.[23]In April 2009 Bart moved to the position of \"vice president and editorial director\", characterized online as \"Boffo No More: Bart Up and Out at Variety\". From mid 2009 to 2013, Timothy M. Gray oversaw the publication as Editor-in-Chief,[24] after over 30 years of various reporter and editor positions in the newsroom.[25]In October 2012 Reed Business Information, the periodical's owner, (formerly known as Reed-Elsevier, which had been parent to Cahner's Corp. in the United States) sold the publication to Penske Media Corporation.[26][27] PMC is the owner of Deadline Hollywood, which since the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike has been considered Variety's largest competitor in online showbiz news. In October 2012, Jay Penske, chairman and CEO of PMC, announced that the website's paywall would come down, the print publication would stay, and he would invest more into Variety's digital platform in a townhall.[28]In March 2013 owner Penske appointed three co-editors to oversee different parts of the publication's industry coverage; Claudia Eller as Editor, Film; Cynthia Littleton as Editor, TV; and Andrew Wallenstein as Editor, Digital. The decision was also made to stop printing Daily Variety with the last printed edition published on March 19, 2013, with the headline \"Variety Ankles Daily Pub Hubbub\".[29][30]In October 2014 Eller and Wallenstein were upped to Co-Editors in Chief, with Littleton continuing to oversee the trade's television coverage. In June 2014, Penske Media Corporation (PMC) entered into an agreement with Reuters to syndicate news from Variety and Variety Latino-Powered by Univision to distribute leading entertainment news to the international news agency's global readership. This dissemination comes in the form of columns, news stories, images, video, and data-focused products. In July 2015, Variety was awarded a Los Angeles Area Emmy Award by the Television Academy in the Best Entertainment Program category for Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a series of one-hour specials that take viewers inside Hollywood films and television programs through conversations with acclaimed actors. A second Los Angeles Area Emmy Award was awarded in 2016.In June 2019, Variety shut down its Gaming section.[31]A significant portion of the publication's advertising revenue comes during the film-award season leading up to the Academy Awards. During this \"Awards Season\", large numbers of colorful, full-page \"For Your Consideration\" advertisements inflate the size of Variety to double or triple its usual page count. These advertisements are the studios' attempt to reach other Hollywood professionals who will be voting on the many awards given out in the early part of the year, including the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and various guild award honors.[citation needed]On December 15, 1906, Variety published its first anniversary number that contained 64 pages, double the size of a regular edition.[45] It published regular bumper anniversary editions each year, most often at the beginning of January, normally with a review of the year and other charts and data, including, from 1938 onwards, lists of the top performing films of the year[46] and, from 1949, the annually updated all-time rental chart.[47]  The editions also contained many advertisements from show business personalities and companies.  The 100th anniversary edition was published in October 2005 listing Variety's icons of the century.[48] Along with the large anniversary editions, Variety also published special editions containing lots of additional information, charts and data (and advertising) for three film festivals: Cannes Film Festival,[49] MIFED Film Market,[50] and American Film Market[51] Daily Variety also published an anniversary issue each October.  This regularly contained a day-by-day review of the year in show business and in the 1970s started to contain republication of the film reviews published during the year.[52]Older back issues of Variety are available on microfilm. In 2010, Variety.com allowed access to digitized versions of all issues of Variety and Daily Variety with a subscription.[53] Certain articles and reviews prior to 1998 have been republished on Variety.com. The Media History Digital Library has scans of the archive of Variety from 1905 to 1963 available online.[54]The first issue of Variety sold 320 copies in 1905.[6]Paid circulation for the weekly Variety magazine in 2013 was 40,000 (Source: BPA Audit Statement, 2013). Each copy of each Variety issue is read by an average of three people, with an estimated total readership of 120,000 (Source: Ipsos Subscriber Study, 2013). Variety.com has 17 million unique monthly visitors (Source: Google Analytics, 2015).[55]For much of its existence, Variety's writers and columnists have used a jargon called slanguage[56] or varietyese (a form of headlinese) that refers especially to the movie industry, and has largely been adopted and imitated by other writers in the industry. The language initially reflected that spoken by the actors of the early days during the newspaper.[10]Such terms as \"legit\", \"boffo\", \"sitcom\", \"sex appeal\", \"payola\", and \"striptease\" are attributed to the magazine.[57] Its attempt to popularize \"infobahn\" as a synonym for \"information superhighway\" never caught on. Television series are referred to as \"skeins\", and heads of companies or corporate teams are called \"toppers\". In addition to a stylistic grammatical blip \u2013 very frequent omissions of the definite article the \u2013, more-common English words and phrases are shortened; \"audience members\" becomes simply \"auds\", \"performance\" \"perf\", and \"network\" becomes \"net\", for example.In 1934, founder Sime Silverman headed a list in Time magazine of the \"ten modern Americans who have done most to keep American jargon alive\".[58]According to The Boston Globe, the Oxford English Dictionary cites Variety as the earliest source for about two dozen terms, including \"show biz\" (1945).[59] In 2005, Welcome Books published The Hollywood Dictionary by Timothy M. Gray and J. C. Suares, which defines nearly 200 of these terms.One of its popular headlines was during the Wall Street Crash of 1929: \"Wall St. Lays An Egg\".[60] The most famous was \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\"[61][62] (the movie-prop version renders it as \"Stix nix hix pix!\" in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), Michael Curtiz's musical\u2013biographical film about George M. Cohan starring James Cagney).In 2012 Rizzoli Books published Variety: An Illustrated History of the World from the Most Important Magazine in Hollywood by Gray. The book covers Variety's coverage of hundreds of world events, from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, through Arab Spring in 2012, and argues that the entertainment industry needs to stay aware of changes in politics and tastes since those changes will affect their audiences. In a foreword to the book, Martin Scorsese calls Variety \"the single most formidable trade publication ever\" and says that the book's content \"makes you feel not only like a witness to history, but part of it too.\"In 2013 Variety staffers tallied more than 200 uses of weekly or Daily Variety in TV shows and films, ranging from I Love Lucy to Entourage.[citation needed]In 2016 Variety endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States, marking the first time the publication endorsed a candidate for elected office in its 111-year history.[63]Variety's first offices were in the Knickerbocker Theatre located at 1396 Broadway on 38th and Broadway in New York. Later it moved to 1536 Broadway at the 45th and Broadway corner until Loew's acquired the site to build the Loew's State Theatre.[5] In 1909, Variety set up its first overseas office in London.[64]In 1920 Sime Silverman purchased an old brownstone building around the corner at 154 West 46th Street in New York, which became the Variety headquarters until 1987, when the publication was purchased.[65] Under the new management of Cahners Publishing, the New York headquarters of the Weekly Variety was relocated to the corner of 32nd Street and Park Avenue South.[65] Five years later, it was downgraded to a section of one floor in a building housing other Cahner's publications on West 18th Street, until the majority of operations were moved to Los Angeles.[citation needed]When Daily Variety started in 1933, its offices were in various buildings near Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd. In 1972, Syd Silverman purchased a building at 1400 North Cahuenga Blvd. which housed the Daily's offices until 1988, after which its new corporate owners and new publisher, Arthur Anderman, moved them to a building on the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard.In late 2008 Variety moved its Los Angeles offices to 5900 Wilshire, a 31-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile area.[66][67] The building was dubbed the Variety Building because a red, illuminated \"Variety\" sign graced the top of the building.[66]In 2013 PMC, the parent company of Variety, announced plans to move Variety's offices to their new corporate headquarters at 11175 Santa Monica Blvd. in Westwood.[66] There, Variety shares the 9-story building with parent company PMC, Variety Insight, Variety 411, and PMC's other media brands, including Deadline.com, HollywoodLife.com, GoldDerby.com, Robb Report and the West Coast offices of WWD and Footwear News.[68]On January 19, 1907, Variety published what is considered the first film review in history. Two reviews written by Sime Silverman were published: Pathe's comedy short An Exciting Honeymoon and Edison Studios' western short The Life of a Cowboy directed by Edwin S. Porter.[69][70] Variety discontinued reviews of films between March 1911 until January 1913[71] as they were convinced by a film producer, believed to be George Kleine, that they were wasting space criticising moving pictures and others had suggested that favorable reviews brought too strong a demand for certain pictures to the exclusion of others.[72] Despite the gap, Variety is still the longest unbroken source of film criticism in existence.[71]In 1930 Variety also started publishing a summary of miniature reviews for the films reviewed that week[73] and in 1951 the editors decided to position the capsules on top of the reviews,[74] a tradition retained today.Writing reviews was a side job for Variety staff, most of whom were hired to be reporters and not film or theatre critics. Many of the publication's reviewers identified their work with four-letter pen names (\"sigs\") rather than with their full names. The practice stopped in August 1991.[75] Those abbreviated names include the following:[7]Variety is one of the three English-language periodicals with 10,000 or more film reviews reprinted in book form. These are contained in the 24-volume Variety Film Reviews (1907\u20131996). Film reviews continue to be published in Variety. The other two periodicals are The New York Times (as The New York Times Film Reviews (1913\u20132000) in 22 volumes) and Harrison's Reports (as Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews (1919\u20131962) in 15 volumes).In 1992 Variety published the Variety Movie Guide containing a collection of 5,000 abridged reviews edited by Derek Elley.[71] The last edition was published in 2001 with 8,500 reviews.[87] Many of the abridged reviews for films prior to 1998 are published on Variety.com unless they have later posted the original review.[88]The complete text of approximately 100,000 entertainment-related obituaries (1905\u20131986) was reprinted as Variety Obituaries, an 11-volume set, including alphabetical index. Four additional bi-annual reprints were published (for 1987\u20131994) before the reprint series was discontinued.The annual anniversary edition published in January would often contain a necrology of the entertainment people who had died that year.[89]Variety started reporting box office grosses for films by theatre on March 3, 1922, to give exhibitors around the country information on a film's performance on Broadway, which was often where first run showings of a film were held. In addition to New York City, they also endeavored to include all of the key cities in the U.S. in the future and initially also reported results for ten other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.[90] They continued to report these grosses for films until 1989 when they put the data into a summarized weekly chart[91] and only published the data by theatre for New York and Los Angeles as well as other international cities such as London and Paris.As media expanded over the years, charts and data for other media such as TV ratings and music charts were published, especially in the anniversary editions that were regularly published each January.During the 1930s charts of the top performing films of the year were published and this tradition has been maintained annually since.[46]In 1946 a weekly National Box Office survey was published on page 3 indicating the performance of the week's hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities.[92][93]Later in 1946 a list of All-Time Top Grossers with a list of films that had achieved or gave promise of earning $4,000,000 or more in domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals was published.[94] An updated chart was published annually for over 50 years, normally in the anniversary edition each January.[95][96]In the late 1960s Variety started to use an IBM 360 computer to collate the grosses from their weekly reports of 22 to 24 U.S. cities from January 1, 1968. The data came from up to 800 theatres which represented around 5% of the U.S. cinema population at the time but around one-third of the total U.S. box office grosses. In 1969, they started to publish the computerized box office compilation of the top 50 grossing films of the week based on this data.[97] \"The Love Bug\" was the number one in the first chart published for the week ending April 16, 1969.[98] The chart format was changed in 1989 to reduce the list to a top 40 and display a summary of the sample city theater grosses rather than publish the theater grosses separately.[91] The sample chart was discontinued in 1990.[99]Arthur D. Murphy, who joined Variety in 1964 and worked there until 1993, was one of the first to organize and chart domestic box office gross information that became more available during the 1980s and report it in a meaningful form setting a standard for how film box office information is reported today.[83] Murphy used the weekly sample reports to estimate the total US weekly box office compared with previous annual totals which was reported in Variety's US Boxoffice Report each week. The sample also allowed Murphy to estimate the Market Share percentage rankings of distributors.[91]In 1976 the Variety Box Office Index (VBI) was launched where each month's actual key city box office tally, after seasonal adjustment, was simultaneously expressed as an index number, with 1970 as a whole being used as the base initially. The current month's VBI expressed the monthly box office performance as a percentage change from the base year.[100] The index was published until 1991 giving a history of comparable monthly and annual box office performance for the past 20 years.During the 1980s, Daily Variety started to publish a weekly chart of the domestic box office grosses of films as compared to the Top 50 chart in Variety which was based on a sample of key markets. Variety started to publish this weekend box office report together with the sample Top 50 chart (later top 40) until they discontinued the sample chart in February 1990 with the weekend box office report being their main source of box office reporting.[99]In 2009 Variety launched a chart showcasing the top performing film trailers ahead of theatrical release in partnership with media measurement firm Visible Measures.[101]In 1937 Variety compiled and published a Radio Directory compiling a record of events in radio such as program histories, ratings and popularity polls.[102] It published an annual edition for the next three years[103] which are available on the Media History Digital Library.In 1981, Variety International Showbusiness Reference was published, which they claimed was the first book to contain a complete list of all winners and nominees for the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, Grammy Awards and Pulitzer Prize. The following year they published Variety major U.S. showbusiness awards containing just this award details and a revised edition, called Variety presents the complete book of major U.S. show business awards, was published in 1985.[104]In 1988, R.R. Bowker, a Reed Reference Publishing Company, part of Reed-Elsevier, PLC, a \"sister\" company to Variety, published Variety's Video Directory Plus, a CD-ROM subscription product, updated quarterly, containing metadata about 90,000 home video products and full-text film reviews from Variety.Peter Cowie joined Variety in 1989[105] and his International Film Guide, which had been published annually since 1964, became Variety International Film Guide with reports from countries on the year in cinema as well as information of film festivals. It continued to bear Variety's name until 2006.[106]In 1990 Variety published a 15-volume set of its television reviews (including home video product) from 1923 to 1988. Additional supplements were published covering 1989\u20131990, 1991-1992 and 1993\u20131994.[107]In 1999 Cowie published The Variety Insider with detailed information on the year in entertainment as well as historical information. A second edition followed in 2000.[108]In November 2014 Variety premiered Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a co-production with PBS SoCal that featured two actors discussing their craft and thoughts on Hollywood, which subsequently went on to win three Emmy awards, including a Daytime Creative Arts Award in May 2019.In January 2017 they launched the Variety Content Studio, creating custom content for brands.[109][110][111][112]Variety established its data and research division, Variety Insight, in 2011 when it acquired entertainment data company, TVtracker.com.[113] Its film database was announced in December 2011 as FlixTracker, but was later folded into Variety Insight. Variety positioned the subscription service as an alternative to crowd-sourced websites, such as the IMDb.[114] The database uses Variety's existing relationships with the studios to get information. The New York Observer identified the main competitor as Baseline StudioSystems.[113] In 2014, Variety Insight added Vscore, a measure of actors' cachet and bankability.[115] In 2015, they partnered with ScriptNoted, a social media website for film scripts.[116]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Billboard_200": "The Billboard 200 is a record chart ranking the 200 most popular music albums and EPs in the United States. It is published weekly by Billboard magazine. It is frequently used to convey the popularity of an artist or groups of artists. Often, a recording act will be remembered by its \"number ones\", those of their albums that outperformed all others during at least one week. The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 in May 1967, and acquired its present title in March 1992. Its previous names include the Billboard Top LPs (1961\u20131972), Billboard Top LPs & Tape (1972\u20131984), Billboard Top 200 Albums (1984\u20131985), and Billboard Top Pop Albums (1985\u20131992).The chart is based mostly on sales (both at retail and digital) of albums in the United States. The weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but since July 2015, tracking week begins on Friday (to coincide with the Global Release Date of the music industry) and ends on Thursday. A new chart is published the following Tuesday with an issue post-dated to the Saturday of that week, four days later.[1] The chart's streaming schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday.[2] New product is released to the American market on Fridays. Digital downloads of albums are also included in Billboard 200 tabulation. Albums that are not licensed for retail sale in the United States (yet purchased in the U.S. as imports) are not eligible to chart. A long-standing policy which made titles that are sold exclusively by specific retail outlets (such as Walmart and Starbucks) ineligible for charting, was reversed on November 7, 2007, and took effect in the issue dated November 17.[3]Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, Billboard updated the methodology of their album chart to also include on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription and online music sales services in the United States.[4][5] Starting on the issue dated January 18, 2020, Billboard updated the methodology to compile the chart again by incorporating video data from YouTube, along with visual plays from digital platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, Vevo, and as of the issue dated March 23, 2021, Facebook.[6][7]As of the issue dated May 7, 2022, the current number-one album on the Billboard 200 is It's Almost Dry by Pusha T.[8]Billboard began an album chart in 1945. Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position Best-Selling Popular Albums chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in album sales as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing twelve-inch albums, with 78 RPM record and long-playing ten-inch album sales decreasing dramatically, Billboard premiered a weekly Best-Selling Popular Albums chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first number-one album on the new weekly list was Belafonte by Harry Belafonte. The chart was renamed to Best-Selling Pop Albums later in 1956, and then to Best-Selling Pop LPs in 1957.Beginning on May 25, 1959, Billboard split the ranking into two charts Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs for stereo albums (30 positions) and Best-Selling Monophonic LPs for mono albums (50 positions). These were renamed to Stereo Action Charts (30 positions) and Mono Action Charts (40 positions) in 1960. In January 1961, they became Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic (15 positions) and Action Albums\u2014Monophonic (25 positions). Three months later, they became Top LPs\u2014Stereo (50 positions) and Top LPs\u2014Monaural (150 positions).On August 17, 1963, the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called Top LPs. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart's title was changed to Top LPs & Tape; in 1984, it was retitled Top 200 Albums; in 1985, it was retitled again to Top Pop Albums; in 1991, it became The Billboard 200 Top Albums; and it was given its current title of The Billboard 200 on March 14, 1992.From the end of 1970 to 1985, Billboard also printed a Bubbling Under the Top LPs albums chart paired with the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 singles chart.  This chart listed albums that had not yet charted on what was then the Top LPs & Tape chart.In 1960, Billboard began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These Essential Inventory charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the Essential Inventory\u2014Mono chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the Mono Action Chart, and stereo albums were moved to the Essential Inventory\u2014Stereo chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the Stereo Action Chart.In January 1961, the Action Charts became Action Albums\u2014Monophonic (24 positions), and Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic (15 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, then were moved to an Essential Inventory list of approximately 200 titles, with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated Top LPs chart debuted in 1963.In 1982, Billboard began publishing a Midline Albums chart (alternatively titled Midline LPs) which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a bi-weekly (and later tri-weekly) basis.On May 25, 1991, Billboard premiered the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. The criteria for this chart were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the Billboard 200.[9] An album needed not have charted on the Billboard 200 at all to qualify for catalog status.Starting with the issue dated December 5, 2009, however, the catalog limitations which removed albums over 18 months old, that have dropped below position 100 and have no currently-running single, from the Billboard 200 was lifted, turning the chart into an all-inclusive list of the 200 highest-selling albums in the country (essentially changing Top Comprehensive Albums into the Billboard 200). A new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the Billboard 200 (dubbed Top Current Albums) was also introduced in the same issue.[10]Billboard has adjusted its policies for Christmas[11] and holiday[11] albums several times. The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a Christmas Albums list was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the Top LPs chart. In 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.In 1983, the Christmas Albums chart was resurrected, but a title's appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the Top Pop Albums chart. In 1994, the chart was retitled Top Holiday Albums. As of 2009, the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the Top Holiday Albums list and the Billboard 200.Since May 25, 1991, the Billboard 200's positions have been derived from Nielsen SoundScan sales data, as of 2008[update] contributed by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than record labels, it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the Recording Industry Association of America when Gold, Platinum and Diamond album awards are announced (RIAA awards reflect wholesale shipments, not retail sales).Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, Billboard updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a \"pure sales-based ranking\" to one measuring \"multi-metric consumption\".[4] With this overhaul, the Billboard 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including Spotify, Beats Music, Google Play, and Xbox Music. Under the new methodology, ten track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. Billboard will continue to publish a pure album sales chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional Billboard 200 methodology, based exclusively on SoundScan's sales data.[4]Beginning on January 18, 2020, Billboard will incorporate video and audio data from YouTube, along with visual plays from streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and Vevo, into the Billboard 200. The change will also impact Billboard's genre-specific album charts.[6]Billboard's \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for Billboard to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album's performance on the Billboard 200 (for example, an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200, two points for a week spent at position 199... up to 200 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an album's year-end total.After Billboard began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.In 2015, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing albums on the chart over the 52 years, along with the best-performing artists.[12] Shown below are the top 10 albums and top 10 artists over the 52-year period of the Billboard 200, through October 2015. Also shown are the artists placing the most albums on the overall \"all-time\" top 100 album list.Source:[13]Source:[14]Source:[13]List of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 since August 17, 1963.Sources:[44][45][46]The following artists are the only ones with 30 or more top-10 albums:[47]Note: As a musician, Paul McCartney has the most top 10 albums, with 51. This includes 32 with The Beatles, 7 albums with the group Wings, 1 album credited to him and his first wife Linda McCartney, and 11 solo albums.[20][21]\u2020 The West Side Story soundtrack ran for 53 weeks at number one on the stereo album chart; it was number one for twelve weeks on the mono album chart.\u2021 The South Pacific soundtrack ran for 28 weeks at number one on the stereo album chart; it was number one for three weeks on the mono album chart.\u0264 This is the Blue Hawaii album's run on the mono album chart; it was number one for four weeks on the stereo album chart.\u2020 Pre-Billboard 200 and Billboard 200Notes:Here are the albums to complete the 10 longest rises to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 since the adoption of Nielsen Music data in 1991.[112]Note: Newhart, Meader, and Fontaine's albums were all #1 on the mono chart, but not on the stereo chart. Garland is listed on a technicality; she has 17 pop hits, but all were from 1939 to 1955, all before the 1958 establishment of the Hot 100.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Prom": "A promenade dance,[1][2] commonly called a prom, is a dance party for high school students. It may be offered in semi-formal black tie or informal suit for boys, and evening gowns for girls. This event is typically held near the end of the school year. There may be individual junior (11th grade) and senior (12th grade) proms or they may be combined.At a prom, a \"prom king\" and a \"prom queen\" may be revealed. These are honorary titles awarded to students elected in a school-wide vote prior to the prom.[3] Other students may be honored with inclusion in a prom court. The selection method for a prom court is similar to that of homecoming queen/princess, king/prince, and court. Inclusion in a prom court may be a reflection of popularity of those students elected and their level of participation in school activities, such as clubs or sports.[4][5]\nThe prom queen and prom king may be given crowns to wear. Members of the prom court may be given sashes to wear and photographed together.[6]Similar events, which may be locally inspired by debutante balls, take place in many other parts of the world. In Canada, the terms \"formal\" and \"Grad\" are often used, while in Australia and New Zealand, the terms school formal and ball are most commonly used for occasions equivalent to the American prom, and the event is usually held for students in Year 12, although the bestowing of the regal titles does not occur. Many schools hold a formal graduation ball for finishing students at the end of the year in place of or as well as a formal. In Ireland, a debutante ball or debs may also be held. In Poland and Lithuania, high schools organize a \"studni\u00f3wka\" (lt. \u201c\u0160imtadienis\u201d). The term \"prom\" is becoming more common in the United Kingdom and Canada because of the influence of American films and television shows, such as Grease. In South Africa this event is widely known as a matric dance as students in their 12th year of school are called matric students.Variation exists between different dialects with regard to whether prom is used with the definite article or not\u2014e.g., whether one says \"go to the prom\" or \"go to prom\".[7]In the early days of high school proms, the nighttime dance served a function similar to a debutante ball. Early proms were times of firsts: the first adult social event for teenagers; the first time taking the family car out after dark; the first real dress-up affair; and so forth. Proms also served as a heavily documented occasion, similar to a milestone event such as first communion or a wedding, in which the participants were taking an important step into a new stage in their lives. In earlier days, the prom may have also served as an announcement of engagement for the 'best couple' after the prom court had been crowned and recognized.[8]While high school yearbooks did not start covering proms and including prom pictures until the 1930s and 1940s, historians, including Meghan Bretz, believe proms may have existed at colleges as early as the late 19th century. The journal of a male student at Amherst College in 1894 recounts an invitation and trip to an early prom at neighboring Smith College for women. The word prom at that time may just have been a fancy description for an ordinary junior or senior class dance, but prom soon took on larger-than-life meaning for high school students.[9]Proms worked their way down incrementally from college gatherings to high school extravaganzas. In the early 20th century, prom was a simple tea dance where high school seniors wore their Sunday best. In the 1920s and 1930s, prom expanded into an annual class banquet where students wore party clothes and danced afterward. As Americans gained more money and leisure time in the 1950s, proms became more extravagant and elaborate, bearing similarity to today's proms. The high school gym may have been an acceptable setting for sophomore dances, but junior prom and senior balls gradually moved to hotel ballrooms and country clubs. Competition blossomed, as teens strove to have the best dress, the best mode of transportation, and the best looking date. Competition for the prom court also intensified, as the designation of prom queen became an important distinction of popularity. In a way, prom became the pinnacle event of a high school student's social life.Today, prom continues to be a notable event in the social climate of high schools. Popular movies and novels attest to the importance of prom themes, prom dates, and prom queens. In some areas, the traditions of prom are not as rigid as they used to be, with many students attending as individuals or in groups instead of as couples. In 1975 U.S. First Daughter Susan Ford held her prom in the East Room of the White House.[10]Traditionally, boys dress in black or white formal wear, often tuxedos regardless of the time of the event, sometimes paired with ties or bow ties with vests, in some cases in colors matching their date's dress.Traditionally, girls wear dresses or evening gowns and adorn themselves with ladies' jewelry such as earrings and a necklace. Traditionally, girls wear perfume, and make-up such as eyeshadow, lipstick, mascara, and blush. Girls also traditionally wear a corsage, given to them by their dates, and girls give boys matching boutonni\u00e8res to be worn on their lapels.A \"promposal\" (a portmanteau of \"prom\" and \"proposal\") is a popular pre-prom tradition where a student asks another to go to the prom with them using some (usually elaborate) method and extra fanfare. A promposal is distinct from the normal prom ask, which typically includes the question, \"Will you go to prom with me?\" without additional spectacle. Promposals may include concepts and materials from posters, confetti, and balloons to the more viral, elaborate plans that give promposals their extravagant reputation. Examples include spelling \"Prom?\" with pepperoni on pizza,[11] organizing a flash mob,[12] wearing a fursuit,[13] graffitiing national park land,[14] and using a hot-air balloon.[15] Promposals, due to their flashy nature, often include a social media aspect like livestreaming, taking and posting videos, and other forms of memorializing on social media platforms.[16]Prom attendees may be limited by their schools to be juniors or seniors and guests under age 21.[17][18] Before prom, girls typically get their hair styled, often in groups as a social activity at a salon. Prom couples then gather at a park, garden, or their own and their dates\u2019 houses for single and group photographs. Prom attendees may rent limousines[19] or party buses[20] to transport groups of friends from their homes to the prom venue. Some schools host their proms at hotel ballrooms, banquet halls, or other venues where weddings typically take place. The dance itself may have a band or DJ.  At prom, a meal may be served.Some high schools allow only the graduating class (seniors) to have a prom. Some schools also allow grade 11 (juniors) to have a prom, and in some cases, there is a combined junior/senior prom. Some American high schools that do not allow school-sponsored dances will host a junior/senior prom as a banquet instead of a dance. Typically, students still dress in formal attire and attend as couples. In recent years, American teens have started asking celebrities or famous models to their proms.[21][22]After the prom, parents or a community may host a prom after-party,[23] afterglow or post-prom[24][25] at a restaurant, entertainment venue, or a student's home. Other traditions often include trips to nearby attractions, such as amusement parks, regional or local parks, or vacation houses. Some of these post-prom events are chaperoned[26] and some are unsupervised. Many post-proms (after-prom events) are at the school, and involve bringing entertainment such as interactive games, artists, and other entertainers to the school, as a means to deter inappropriate behaviors.In the United Kingdom prior to the 2000s, many secondary schools would hold events such as a summer ball to celebrate the end of term or a leavers ball to celebrate the end of schooling, but usually, these did not have the cultural or social significance of US-style proms.[citation needed]In the 1970s, school discos had been another tradition of semi-formal events being held at various times of the year, in particular during the Christmas period, although not all secondary schools would allow such events.[citation needed]During the 2000s, school proms became common at UK schools, apparently due to the influence of US TV shows.[27] The Daily Telegraph reported in 2012 that:[28]elaborate 'passing out' celebrations for Year 11 students (aged 15\u201316) and Year 12 (aged 17\u201318) have become a cultural phenomenon, stoking passions and rivalries, and refashioning the sense of what a school party should be. More than 85 percent of schools in Britain hold school Proms, which range from no-frills dinners in school halls to tailor-made extravaganzas in five-star hotels with such extras as ice- cream vans and photo booths.Schools in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland predominantly hold their prom, or school formal, at the end of secondary education in year 11 (ages 15/16) and the end of sixth form (aged 18).[citation needed]In Scotland, it is usually only held at the end of S6 (ages 17/18) because all high schools in Scotland have pupils up to age 18 years, whereas elsewhere in the UK, many students have to go to college to study for A-Levels. Proms are usually held in June, after the end of year exams, although in Northern Ireland, they are usually held in the wintertime near the start of the school year. At Scottish formal events, boys usually wear kilts (kilts are also often seen in the other Celtic regions) and Highland dress outfitters often sell out in an area around this time of year due to demand from school events. Also in Scotland, it is customary for traditional Scottish country dancing (part of the curriculum of all secondary schools) to be included.[citation needed]In Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, and Tanzania most private schools with expatriates have proms or \"end of year socials\".In Egypt, private schools have proms similar to ones held in the United States but with slight differences. The prom is held for a maximum of 3 hours, where teachers attend and enjoy some time with their students. Then there is the \"after-prom\", where no teachers or parents are allowed, during that time, the real party begins with all the students dancing and enjoying their time. The after-prom can continue to 4 am and 5 am. In some places, there is no mingling of males and females due to adherence to the Islamic codes.[29]In South Africa, the equivalent of the American prom is the Matric Dance, taking place during the matriculation (i.e., final) year of high school (12th grade). It takes place towards the end of the third quarter, shortly before the spring break, after which the matriculation examinations commence. It usually takes the form of a formal dinner and dance. In most schools, the 11th-grade class is responsible for arranging the event. Sometimes teachers and parents also attend.The Matric Dance has become one of the most popular occasions on the South African social calendar, but not without much controversy for its cost that, it is said, \"could be as much as some people\u2019s weddings\". The magazine saying this elaborates: \"Many parents will be torn between wanting to spoil their youngsters and wanting to resist the extravagance of handing over thousands of rands for a dress or suit that will probably only be worn once.\"[30]In Zambia, private schools have a \"leavers' dance/dinner\" that is planned out by the grade 11 class and takes place on the Saturday after the Friday of their graduation ceremony. The dance is planned for the grade 12 class as well as the upper sixth form class and is normally done the 1st Friday after both of the classes are done writing their A-Level and IGCSE examinations. The dinner begins at 7 pm and the grade 11 class pose as the servers as well as the entertainment throughout the duration of the dinner. The dinner ends at midnight and is followed by the \"after-party\" which is celebrated at another venue (usually a club) with no parents and no teachers. Costs for renting out the venue are covered by selling tickets to outsiders and the party is usually planned by the graduating classes themselves.In Hong Kong, prom culture is inherited from the western countries and is generally called a ball, such as Christmas Ball. This usually takes place during Christmas and summer break. This is more popular in the secondary education stage rather than in universities. Schools, excluding international schools, holding proms are usually single-sex schools where normally the student unions in the schools will cooperate with each other in organizing the event. In recent years, more and more individual unions got united and formed different student unions associations so as to organize large-scale events including large joint-school proms. Except for those proms within the academic field, there are also adult proms for charity yearly where celebrities and government officers always go to these functions.In India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, the equivalent to some extent is a farewell party or farewell gathering. The outgoing students are given a warm send-off by the junior students and staff. All the seniors are felicitated with souvenirs and superlatives are given awards. There are also a couple of dances due to the influence of American culture and movies in India.In Pakistan, there is a prom or farewell function that takes place at the end of the college academic year. Students dress in formal attire. The event ends with a photography session with the graduating batch.In Afghanistan, there is a lunch party organized by the graduating students and called \"graduation party.\" This is mostly seen in the university level graduation after the 16th class with a bachelor's degree, this day all the university seniors, faculty members, and professors are invited as honors. There is no mingling of males and females due to strict adherence to the Islamic codes.In Bangladesh, an event called 'Rag Day' is held at the end of 10th grade and 12th grade. There the school authority decorates the school and make musical arrangements. The students take celebratory preparations like making a uniform T-shirt (generally white) to commemorate the day. The juniors of the school also spend money, help organize the party and give farewell to the seniors. At the end of the party, graduating students play with powdered colors and signs on each others t-shirt to mark all the friendships they made in their school life.In Israel, high school graduation parties usually combine a play and a humble ceremony, followed by a dance party. In the past years, influenced by American culture, more and more graduates decide to hold a private graduation party similar to the American prom, with dress code, prom dates, limousines, and prom kings or queens, although usually not supported by the school.In Lebanon, proms are held after the graduation ceremony at night. They are usually held at hotels with a formal dress code, prom dates, rented cars, and, occasionally, prom kings and queens. The interaction between males and females is not limited.In Turkey, the equivalent is called Graduation Ball. The type of event and the rules applied are created by the student governments and school boards. It is a graduation tradition for seniors.In the Philippines, proms are popular in high schools. Prom usually takes place in the junior and senior years of high school, normally around February or March. Proms are commonly known as JS prom, or, junior-senior prom. Conversely, if a high school has separate dances for juniors and seniors, the term \"prom\" is reserved for the juniors, and the dance for the seniors is called a \"graduation ball\" (often abbreviated as \"grad ball\" or simply \"ball\".) The associated student body generally organizes the event. Usually, a prom king and queen are chosen. The basis for the king and queen judgment is the beauty and the fashion of the nominee, not the popularity.In Singapore, proms are held at the near end of a senior year for secondary schools or tertiary institutions. Proms are normally held after the final examinations of all senior students before graduating.In Vietnam, the equivalent to the prom is called li\u00ean hoan cu\u1ed1i n\u0103m. Some schools hold their li\u00ean hoan cu\u1ed1i n\u0103m at restaurants, but the majority of schools prefer simple \"tea parties\" with snacks and soft drinks inside their classrooms. Unlike in other countries, students don't dress up in dresses or tuxedos; they simply wear school uniforms to the tea parties.In Albania, \"mbr\u00ebmja e matur\u00ebs\", as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. Every school organizes it independently and the event usually takes place in June or July. Ceremonially, it is very similar to prom nights in the United States.[citation needed]In Belgium, as well as in some parts of the Netherlands, senior students celebrate their last 100 days of high school with a special day called Chrysostomos or 100-dagen feest (\u201c100-days party\u201d). Tradition states that on this winter day, seniors are allowed to pull pranks on their teachers and fellow students. Some schools handle a theme as dresscode, while others go for the traditional outfit: blue jeans, a black cotton jacket, a black hat (with a red or blue ribbon), and a whistle around the neck. Some even paint their faces and some seniors also carry a spray can (shaving cream or other fluids) to \u201cattack\u201d the non-seniors with. A noisy march through town is also part of the gig. Later during the day, students perform an act at school, usually a silly show involving school or a parody. In the evening, students head to a rented club to party. This involves dancing, singing, and plenty of beer to get a taste of fraternity life. Sometimes even teachers join the party to show that they too have a wild side. In the Netherlands, households where a child who has passed their high school exams often hang the student's backpack on a flagpole which is attached to the front of the house.In Bulgaria, the ball is called abiturientski bal and is held at the end of 12th grade, when you are aged 18/19. Preparations for the ball begin at the end of the 11th grade, because students are supposed to organize the whole event. It is celebrated in May, mainly on the 23rd, 24th, or 25th, after finishing exams. Students can bring a date to the event which is usually held in a restaurant or a club. Usually, before the main event there is a big gathering in front of the high school's building, where graduates count to 12 (as in 12 grades) and take photos with each other before going to the restaurant called izprashtane (\u201cfarewell send off\u201d). At the main event in the restaurant/hotel, there is music, usually pop and retro. Students are free to dance with whomever they want, even if they have come with a date. The school director and the 12th-grade teachers are also sometimes invited. There is usually an afterparty at a dance club. Some people even organize a second afterparty. After the prom night, students usually go on an excursion together for 3 to 5 days. The popular destinations are the Black Sea coast and Turkey. The event is often associated with excess in drinking, drugs, sex, and lavish nouveau-riche style of dressing and parading (there are families that would spend as much as a year's salary on their son or daughter' s night). The media regularly criticize it, deploring the decadence of morals.In the Czech Republic, the last year in Gymnasium is celebrated with maturitn\u00ed ples (\u201cgraduation ball\u201d). This ball takes place before exams are taken, usually in January or February, the traditional season for balls during the Fasching (e.g., List of balls in Vienna). Normally, balls are formal but modern elements are included, too. The students invite their parents, other relatives, and friends to come to the ball with them. The balls usually have a theme and the classes perform choreographed dance routines at the beginning or during the evening. The students also receive a ribbon. It's common that various artists are invited to perform at the ball, ranging from fireshow performers to famous celebrities. At midnight, the classes perform a \"midnight surprise performance\" \u2013 typically some sort of funny act. Sometimes several schools organize a joint event. The income is often used to finance a collective voyage of the students after the exams.In Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and North Macedonia, matursko ve\u010de (maturalna ve\u010der and maturska ve\u010der), as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. It is similar to prom night in the United States. In Croatia, it is sometimes held in January or February.In Denmark, the prom is called galla and takes place before the exams begin. The word galla refers to the dress code which is dresses for the women and suits for the men. The prom in Denmark is well known for keeping the traditional dance Les Lanciers, where the third graders of high school (the seniors) start the whole dance, then the 1st and 2nd graders join later on (the high school, called \"gymnasium\" in Denmark, is three years).In Estonia, the equivalent of the prom is often called Saja p\u00e4eva ball. The event takes place 100 days prior to graduation and maybe organized with several schools altogether. Students can dance but other events may be involved, too, besides ballroom dancing. The clothes are much the same kind as in the proms of other countries.In Finland, the equivalent of the prom is called vanhojen tanssit (senior ball). The event is held in February when third-year high school students (the abi) end regular classes in order to prepare for their final abitur exams, and the second year students become the oldest in the school. For the remainder of the school year, the second-year students are called vanhat (\"the old\", or \" the seniors\").For the ball, the second-year students learn 10\u201315 formal dances, mostly old ballroom dances such as the mazurka or a polonaise. Lately, some schools have begun to allow students to perform their own choreographies with their chosen music, after or in between the old ballroom dances.In the past, the style was to dress in Victorian gowns and in an old-fashioned way, but these days the attire is similar to U.S. proms. Usually, girls wear a long princess gown or a ball gown and the boys wear a black suit.\nAfter the ball, the students sometimes attend a dinner in the evening, which is sometimes in a very formal restaurant. Sometimes students throw a party in the evening to celebrate further.In France, high school students have only recently experienced prom. On June 27, 2013, more than 300 students in Paris, France held a prom.[31][32] Event planning company White-Tie-Affair partnered up with multiple local companies to host the \u201cSolidarity Prom Ball\u201d charity gala. Food, drinks, venue, limousine,[33] as well as gift bags were sponsored by the different companies and provided for the students for free. On top of that, famous French music groups Psy4 de la Rime and Alibi Montana were the guest performance of the evening. All proceeds from the students\u2019 entrance fee were donated to Donnons Leur Une Chance, a French non-profit organization[34] that will help realize educational projects.In Germany (and Austria), students celebrate their graduation from high school, or Gymnasium, with an Abifeier (from the graduation certificate or Abitur) or Maturaball (in Austria, the graduation exam is called Matura). In Germany, the events are informal and usually contain a series of student-organized activities that tend to make fun of teachers, sometimes with an extended hagiography about the favorite teacher. In Austria, the Maturaball is formal and can be seen as a synergy of proms and cotillions and often are highlights of the regional ball season (between November and the end of Carnival) referencing the glamour of the great ball tradition of the former Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. More like the prom is the German Abiball, that follows the official graduation ceremony. Here the students usually wear suits and ball gowns. The Abiball often follows a certain order with a welcome, introductions, an award ceremony for students, and sometimes an extended demonstration of all of the artistic outpourings of the students and staff. This is followed by a band (sometimes the school's own band, if there is any) or a DJ playing music, usually starting with a waltz before moving on to other dancing. Alcohol is available at these events since the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 (for beer and wine), and most graduating students are 18 or older.In Hungary, students receive a ribbon to mark the beginning of the preparation for their graduation. Students receive this ribbon at a ball called \"szalagavat\u00f3\", meaning the \"inauguration of ribbons\". Many of the students wear this ribbon on their jackets or shirts until graduation. This prom-like evening dance is traditionally held in the ball season of January\u2013February, but November-December has gained popularity in recent years as well. At the beginning of the ball, after a short speech by the headteacher, each student gets the ribbon from their form teacher who pins it on their jacket or dress. Then a series of choreographed dances begin, which the students learned during the months leading up to the event. The first one is traditionally a dance called \"palot\u00e1s\" (palace dance) performed by students from different classes, then each graduating class performs their own class dance, and finally, there's a waltz, which is also performed by students from different classes. Occasionally, the teachers of the school perform a dance as well. After the ball of the evening organized by the school, students usually go out at night to drink to bars and discos, even if some of them are below the drinking age (18 in Hungary).After they graduate, each class has its own party (without choreographed dances) usually at a restaurant, where their teachers are also invited. This is called \u00e9retts\u00e9gi bankett (graduation banquet).In the Republic of Ireland, a school leavers' dance is called a \"Debs\" or \"Grads\". In girls schools, it is commonly referred to as a Debs (short for \"Debutante ball\", though less formal than the high-society event sharing that name in other countries), and in boys and coeducational schools, it may be referred to as a Grads or Grad (short for graduation). It is typically a formal dance for students who are graduating from secondary school (high school) in Ireland and is traditionally held between September and October. Alcohol is almost always served at these events, with a meal also being common.[35][36]In Lithuania, the prom is held after final exams, usually the same day when high school diplomas are presented. The event is called i\u0161leistuv\u0117s.In Norway, this event varies from school to school. It is usually held during the winter months, and is often called \"Nytt\u00e5rsball\" which means \"the new years ball.\" The students are not allowed to bring people from outside the school. In Norway, it is the norm to have proms for 8th, 9th, and 10th graders at Norwegian middle school, and most of the time, there is no division between formal and grad \u2013 students can attend in whatever clothing they choose, such as traditional knee-long dresses.The Polish equivalent of the prom (studni\u00f3wka) is a very popular event held each year throughout the country; the word itself means \"of or relating to 100 days\". Most schools organize such an event about 100 days before the (matura) exam session. The first dance of the prom is the traditional Polish polonaise. In the past, the dress code for the studni\u00f3wka was the same as for final exams, i.e. a white blouse or shirt with a dark skirt or trousers. As opposed to the studni\u00f3wka, formal attire is required for the so-called Grand Ball (\"bal maturalny\"), held after graduation. Nowadays, as Grand Balls are rare, the studni\u00f3wka has adopted a formal dress code.In Portugal, there was no prom tradition. However, during the last few years schools have adopted such a celebration. Usually, they happen before the end of the school year, in May or June, and are called \"Baile de Finalistas\" (Finalist's Ball). The students wear formal suits and dresses. It is usually organized by a student association, elected at the beginning of the school year by the students to organize school events.Although it happens in the majority of the country, on Madeira Island the tradition is a bit different. Instead of having the prom at the end of the year, the seniors have a ceremony called \"Ben\u00e7\u00e3o das Capas\" (Cape's Blessing), where they all use suits, including the girls, and a cape that is blessed by the city's cardinal. Afterward, the students have dinner with their friends and family and then go to the prom. However, this prom isn't formal, it ends up being similar to a club but in a different location, although sometimes it may happen at a club. Such a location is chosen by the student association. This ceremony ends up being very similar to one that the Portuguese students have when they finish college. The students only have a date to attend the first ceremony and they tend to go to the prom as groups.In Romania, distinct proms are held each year in high schools and college for both the graduating students as well as the newly enrolled ones. They are called graduation balls and freshmen (\"boboci\", meaning \"hatchlings\" in Romanian) balls, respectively. They are usually not black tie (informal). The venue is chosen by the teaching staff and can be any place, including the school gym or auditorium, a club, or a restaurant. It is common to charge students an admission tax in order to offset the cost. One or more bands or singers are usually hired to provide entertainment. Often the event is sponsored by local businesses. Access is usually controlled and limited to students of that particular high school or university, but exceptions can be made for relatives and it is not uncommon for students from other institutions to try to crash a particular prom. Freshmen proms usually include a popularity contest of some sort, which designates 3 girls and 3 boys as places I, II and III \"most popular\" as chosen by student vote; the candidates have to undergo various entertaining challenges, which usually include pair dancing. Generally speaking, freshmen proms are the more popular, with college freshmen proms often being publicized as club events and promoted by radio stations, who take the opportunity to introduce bands and singers. Whereas graduation proms are more subdued and often not a public or even a school-wide event, many graduating classes choosing to restrict attendance just to the actual graduates and their teachers.In Belarus and Russia proms are called \"Vypuskn\u043ei vech\u0435r\" (\u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440), which literally means \"graduation evening\". They take place from the 18th to the 20th or the 23rd to the 25th of June, after the state exams are completed. Proms are never held on the 21st/22nd because they took place on June 21 in 1941, but on the 22nd all graduates were drafted to fight the German invasion during World War II. First, all graduates receive their diplomas. Students with higher marks receive them first. Afterward, the prom continues as a school ball, traditionally with classic dances. Students may choose restaurants, cafes, or ships rather than school grounds to hold the events. Proms may be held in a discoth\u00e8que, but it must start with the school waltz. At the conclusion of the prom evening, it is tradition to walk the whole night and watch the sunrise in the morning (on a hill, if applicable, in Moscow\u00a0\u2013 Sparrow Hills).In Slovakia, the closest thing to prom is Stu\u017ekov\u00e1, an occasion when the seniors get together with their parents, partners and teachers to celebrate their upcoming graduation. It takes place in November or December. Each of the students receives a green ribbon with their name on it (thus the name Stu\u017ekov\u00e1, the \"Ribbon Ball\"). The principal and the class teacher are given big green ribbons as well. Many of the students wear this ribbon on their jackets or shirts until graduation. Stu\u017ekov\u00e1 typically includes a banquet, skits and songs prepared by students, as well as dancing. Men wear formal suits and women formal dresses. One week before Stu\u017ekov\u00e1 is a ceremony of Pe\u010datenie triednej knihy (Sealing of the grades book) so that teachers will not be able to give tests or do examinations of the students until Stu\u017ekov\u00e1. It is connected with some story and recorded on camera and then used as a part of the video of Stu\u017ekov\u00e1. It usually starts at 6 p.m. and ends in the early hours of the next morning (4a.m.).In Slovenia, the equivalent is Maturantski ples. It is held before the final exams between January and May, depending on the region and school. Students can bring dates and/or close family to the ball. It is a custom that each student dances the last dance of the first sequence, a Vienna Walzer, with his mother/her father. There is also a dinner and live music.In some places in Spain, proms are also celebrated as after-school parties. These parties are commonly called \"fiestas de graduaci\u00f3n\", which can be translated as \"graduation parties\".In Sweden, this kind of event is usually known as \"Studentbalen\". The word \"Studentbalen\" is a proper noun meaning \"The Student Ball,\" while the word studentbal is a common noun that can refer to any formal dinner and dance at a Swedish university. Studentbalen is usually held during the final weeks before graduating and can be formal.The Swiss equivalent of a prom is the bal de printemps.[37] Literally translated, this is a \"Spring Ball.\"  At some schools in the German-speaking cantons, it is called \"Maturaball.\" This is not always organized by the schools, but sometimes by a student's committee. It takes the most part before the final exams.In Ukraine, prom is called \"Vypusknyi vechir\" or simply \"vypusknyi\" (\u0412\u0438\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0456\u0440 or simply \u0412\u0438\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043d\u0438\u0439), which literally means \"graduation evening\". The date is defined by a school,;[38][39] usually any date from late May to mid-June. Usually, \"vypusknyi\" consists of two parts. The first one called \"urochysta chastyna\" (\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430, that means \"solemn part\"), during which graduates receive their diplomas and certificates of honor for exceptional achievements during studying. The first part is conducted in the first part of the day, while the second part usually starts in the evening. The time between the two parts is used to walk around a city and take some pictures. The second part, \"ne ofitsiyna chastyna\" (\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430, that means \"informal part\"), starts as a school ball, but after a round of waltz, it transforms into a conventional party. The venue of the second part is determined by graduates and their parents; usually, it takes place in school, cafe, restaurant, on a boat or at the country. Traditionally, the second part is attended by graduates, their parents, and teachers. However, school teachers and parents don't mix with graduates. The second part ends with sunrise. Usually, each city has one or a few locations that are the most popular for watching a sunrise. That is why schools try not to have proms on the same date.In Australia and New Zealand, the tradition is similar to schools in the United States. However, if the event is not described to the final year, it may be described as a Ball, School Formal, or simply Formal. If the event is in the final year of high school, it is sometimes called a Dinner-dance, Leavers' Dinner or Debutante Ball but is also commonly called a School Formal or \"Formal.\"  In Australia, some schools may also have a Valedictory Dinner, which is like the formal but has students, parents, and teachers instead of students and dates.As the name suggests, attire for the occasion is generally formal.[40] Boys will usually dress in a suit and tie. Girls traditionally wear formal gowns or dresses. In most cases a school formal is held at a local reception center or ballroom. A multicourse meal is generally provided.  After the meal students generally dance to popular music played by a hired DJ or sometimes a band. Many students group together to go to the formal in a limousine. While parents do not attend a formal, teachers may act as chaperones for the formal and security guards are sometimes hired. The use of chaperones is intended to prevent the occurrence of violence and alcohol or drug use. Generally, after a formal, one or more after-parties are held.In addition to the high school graduation \"formal\" that marks the end of Year 12, there is also an event that is sometimes held to celebrate completing the School Certificate at the end of Year 10 (or Year 11 in New Zealand), and always held after receiving Higher School Certificate at the end of Year 12 and includes a dinner and dance. The NSW Government announced the abolition of the School Certificate after 2011, with students in year 10 that year being the final cohort to sit the external examinations and receive the qualification. Subsequent Year 10 \"Formals\" have been deemed \"unnecessary\" due to the fact that the majority of Year 10 students now progress to Year 11. In previous years when 25\u201330% of students left high school in Year 10, the Formal was seen as a celebration for those departing, however, Year 10 Formals are still sometimes celebrated in the name of tradition. In year 11, students occasionally organize a \"semi-formal\" or \"social\" at the end of the school year, which is a more casual version of a formal. If a school has a sister school the social is typically organized in conjunction with them, as a \"social event\" for people to mingle and meet new people. The Valedictory Dinner (or Val as it is colloquially called) is an event that only occurs in Year 12. In New Zealand, most state school balls are held in the winter months, between June and August, while in Australia, a \"formal\" is held at the end of the year to mark the end of schooling, as is the Valedictory Dinner.In American Samoa, the typical Junior/Senior prom is held in most of the schools, an exception would be one of the private schools, which lets even 8th graders, freshmen, and sophomores participate in prom.In Mexico, most high schools and junior high (middle) schools have proms only for the graduating class (seniors), which is sometimes, depending on whether the school is private or public, preceded by a church service. The students dress in formal wear and may attend in couples. Some colleges have an after-graduation dinner dance.The formals, or as called in Mexico galas or graduaciones, are normally held in the school's gymnasium or in the schoolyard if the school is located in a low-income neighbourhood; normally, though, public schools located in high- or medium-income neighbourhoods and private schools rent a ballroom, usually in a hotel, and students and parents may chip in to cover the costs of the party.A multicourse meal is often offered in private schools' proms; antojitos may be offered in low-budget proms instead.Venezuelans also have a prom, commonly referred to as \"graduaci\u00f3n\" or \"fiesta de graduaci\u00f3n.\" It can consist of dancing, dinner, and live music.In Argentina, there are \"fiestas de egresados\" for students finishing their last year of high school. These consist of big parties hosted by the senior students in local discos or other venues, starting at 10 p.m. until about 5 or 6 in the morning. They have dinner with parents and other members of the family, which may be at another venue such as the school, and on a different night altogether. After midnight friends and other guests join the dance. The parties start in late September after most students come back from their senior trip, commonly to Bariloche, and last until early December, after the graduation. The students may dress formally or casually, and the seniors may wear themed costumes.In Brazil, bailes de formatura are usual at the end of high school and at college graduation. There is no crowning of a \"king\" or a \"queen,\" but evening gowns and suits are required. The family may or may not be included, and there may be a live band or DJ hired to command the music.In Chile, proms, or \"fiestas de graduaci\u00f3n\" (graduation parties), are usually held at convention centers or hotels after the \"licenciatura,\" or graduation from high school. They can also be held after taking the PSU (Chilean University Entrance Exam) in December. Students are expected to dress formally. They are allowed to go with dates or friends. After the dinner, the dance continues through the night into the next day.In Colombia, many private schools usually have prom balls as well, usually consisting of a dinner, dancing, live music, and contests. They are usually held at hotels or clubs.In Costa Rica, like many other American countries, the \"Baile de graduaci\u00f3n\" is celebrated after finishing high school, where grade 11 is also the last year. It usually takes place before graduation to celebrate the end of school. It's normally held in hotels or saloons with a dance floor, music and dinner. It starts with the students walking through the dance floor and dancing a waltz. The dinner comes after, and the rest of the night consists of dancing and celebration.In Honduras, they are called \"Cena de Graduacion\", they are held in luxury hotels, also familiars of the graduating students are invited. This event is held only for private schools, the act consists on formal graduation and delivery of their diplomas, after that, a dinner is held between the graduating students and their familiars or friends in the same room which later will become in a dance floor for everyone.In Peru, proms\u2014\"Fiestas de Promoci\u00f3n\"\u2014are usually held at hotels, convention centers, or big residences. The dress code is formal. Some parents and teachers are often invited, but they don't stay the whole night. Dinner is served as well as alcoholic drinks and delicatessen. Breakfast is often served the next day, at around 6\u20137 am. There is a growing tradition to hold a pre-prom for the students in the class below the graduating class, and even a pre-pre-prom for the students in the class below that.In Trinidad and Tobago and most Caribbean countries, it is traditional for schools to hold a dance at the end of the CXC/GCE Advanced Level examination period. This is thrown simultaneously for fifth form and upper sixth form students during the months of June or July after the school's official graduation ceremony. It is colloquially referred to as grad or gradz.  Most gradz are held in popular clubs, hotels, halls or simply on the school's grounds. Most schools allow students to bring dates, and a formal dress code is usually in effect.In Uruguay, graduation parties are usually held after graduation. These parties can be organized by the school or by the students themselves. Usually, a place is rented, and formal parties are held. Students are allowed to take one guest, as a friend or as a partner.The concept of extending prom to homeschool students has been realized in recent years. Although some school districts in the United States and Canada allow homeschool students to attend the prom in the school district where they reside, many homeschool groups also organize their own proms. Some states, such as Oregon,[41] Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Michigan, also host statewide homeschool proms, which any homeschool student in that state is welcome to attend.Proms that are specifically geared toward homeschool students can sometimes be significantly different from traditional high school proms. It is not uncommon for a homeschool student to attend a homeschool prom solo, rather than taking a date. Often the music played is chosen by the parents rather than the students.An adult prom is a social event that is almost perfectly similar to a high school prom in terms of themes and attire, except that some adult proms also serve alcoholic beverages, and therefore most adult proms (at least in the U.S.) require those attending to be at least 21 years of age. The origin of adult prom is unclear, though Drew Barrymore is often credited with inadvertently inventing the concept in the 1990s, when she stated in an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien that she threw a prom party for herself and a few friends who never got to go to prom.[42]A form of adult prom is the \"second chance prom\". It is a big gathering of people who either did not go to prom, wanted to relive prom, or whose high school prom did not work out the way they had hoped.In the novel Nobody's Property, character Mallorie Walcott, an event planner, mentions that she helped put her younger daughter Cassandra through college, in part, from the revenue she made from planning adult proms in the 1990s either for people who missed their actual high school proms in the 1970s and 1980s or simply wanted to re-live their prom night.A slightly different take on the adult prom is that of the disabilities prom, dedicated to providing a prom experience to disabled adults at no charge to the attendees. These events are most often organized by non-profit organizations focusing on the disabled, or large churches.[43]In 2010, Theatrical producers in New York produced an audience participation theatrical play, set in an actual dance hall, called The Awesome 80s Prom,[44] where attendees were at a prom and got to vote on the king and queen from the cast of characters.Anti-proms can be private, unofficial proms that are privately created, outside the control of the school, usually by people who disagree with their school's prom policies. Some schools also include the anti-prom as an official event called MORP (Prom spelled backwards).  MORP dances can be similar to a Sadie Hawkins dance where the girls ask a boy on a date, they can have informal attire, and the decor can be dark or less elegant.Proms for gay and lesbian people who did not attend their proms with a date of the same sex are popular in some cities.[45] These proms may also enable trans people who experienced prom before transitioning a chance to attend as the correct gender. A 1980 court decision, Fricke v. Lynch, required a public school in Rhode Island to allow same-sex dates, but discrimination against gay students continued for decades across the country.Proms have been the source of many controversies, many of which involve LGBT students.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Billboard_Global_200": "The Billboard Global 200 is a weekly record chart published by Billboard magazine. The chart ranks the top songs globally and is based on digital sales and online streaming from over 200 territories worldwide. First announced in mid-2019, it officially launched in September 2020.The first number-one song for the chart dated September 19, 2020, was \"WAP\" by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion.[1] The current number-one as of the chart dated May 7, 2022, is \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles.[2]Billboard had been working on the idea of a global chart for over two years prior to its launch.[3] The chart was first announced on May 6, 2019, then envisioned as the \"Global 100\" and it was to launch later that year.[4] The motivation for the chart's conception was \"to expose people to music from multiple territories and in time\", to provide \"overdue exposure and recognition for acts from international markets\". With the chart's official announcement on September 14, 2020, Billboard described it as \"the first\u00a0authoritative charts ranking the top songs globally\", and stated that basing the chart on worldwide streams and download sales, \"will give an accurate glimpse into the most popular songs on the planet\".[3]Establishing a global chart was dependent on the availability of the data, as well as having the various streaming and digital retail services \"willing to participate and provide data\"; Billboard considered this \"not an easy task\" and the reason why it took so long to launch a global chart.[5]\"As the steward of the definitive industry charts, we're thrilled to unveil out our global charts which give the industry insights into the most powerful artists worldwide, what songs have an international impact, as well as what songs may start trending outside of the United States\". \u2013 MRC Data and MRC Media & Info president\u00a0Deanna Brown.[3]The chart officially premiered on Billboard's website on September 15, 2020, for the chart week dated September 19, 2020.[1] The first number-one song on the chart was \"WAP\" by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion.[1]The chart methodology includes sales and streaming data from more than 200 territories. Positions are measured on a weighted formula which incorporates official streams from both subscription and ad-supported levels of top digital platforms, including both audio and video music services, and download sales from top music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded.[6] Streams are \"weighted\" through paid subscriptions holding more weight than streams from free subscriptions.[7] On the question about the increasing prevalence of fake streams that call into question whether consumers can trust the information on music streaming platforms,  Billboard explained that they \"have worked closely with our data providers to implement various audit guidelines to limit any significant effect of manufactured streams. In addition, each data provider has their own safeguards in place to recognize fraudulent behavior and catch it before it gets to their data partners, including\u00a0Billboard and MRC Data\".[5] \nUnlike the US-based Billboard Hot 100, the Global 200 does not have a \"recurrent\" rule, therefore allowing songs from any period in music history to chart. The recurrent rule on the Hot 100 indicates that descending songs are removed once they fall below number 25 after 52 weeks, or once below number 50 after 20 weeks.[8] The chart does not factor in any form of radio airplay, as, according to MRC Data, \"The focus was on metrics that could be systematically measured in each country\", considering how \"unlike streaming and download sales, radio is not reliably measured at this time [2020] in many territories and, even if tracked, is not done consistently from country to country\".[7] As such, the chart has been noted for being similar to the Rolling Stone Top 100, which, although it is a US song chart, also only incorporates sales and streams in their chart formula.[7][dubious  \u2013 discuss]The chart follows a \"unique, revenue-reflective\" methodology reflecting the global market. \nThe official chart methodology is as follows:Each ranking is based on\u00a0stream equivalent units\u00a0using the following formula:\n(Tracks * 200)\u00a0+ premium streams\u00a0+ (ad-supported streams / 4.5)[5]The chart follows a Friday\u2013Thursday tracking week.[3] It is compiled by MRC Data/Nielsen Music through their Music Connect product, a recently launched music measurement and analytics platform, and is published every Tuesday on Billboard.com.[1][9]Along with the Global 200, Billboard launched another, similar chart: the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart. This chart follows the same formula as the Global 200, except, as the name suggests, it covers all territories excluding the US.[3] Billboard stated their reasoning for having two charts: \"One of the goals for this project was to expose people to music from multiple territories. So having each chart go 200 titles deep and also presenting a view of titles excluding U.S. influence was of great importance to us\".[5] The first number-one song for the chart dated September 19, 2020, was \"Haw\u00e1i\" by Maluma.[1]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/International_Federation_of_the_Phonographic_Industry": "The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) is the organisation that represents the interests of the recording industry worldwide. It is a non-profit members' organisation registered in Switzerland and founded in Italy in 1933. It operates a secretariat based in London, with regional offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Abu Dhabi and Nairobi.IFPI's mission is to promote the value of recorded music, campaign for record producer rights, and expand the commercial uses of recorded music.[1] Its services to members include a legal policy programme, litigation, content protection, sales reporting for the recorded music market, insight and analysis and work in the areas of performance rights, technology and trade.[2]IFPI is governed by its Main Board, a group including representatives from across the organisation's members (including major and independent record labels), representatives from certain IFPI National Groups and the organisation's CEO.[3] There are also two regional boards (the IFPI Asia/Pacific Regional Board and IFPI Latin America Regional Board) which oversee regional matters.[3]Frances Moore is the current CEO. She was appointed the chief executive with a term effective from 1 July 2010.[4] She replaced John Kennedy, who had headed the organisation since 2005 and was also one of the co-producers of Live Aid and Live8.[5]IFPI represents the recording industry worldwide; there are some 8,000 members across IFPI and its National Group network, operating in over 70 countries and over 70 national groups, affiliated music licensing companies and IFPI offices.[1] According to its criteria, IFPI membership is open to \"a legal entity or person which is either a producer of phonograms or music videos, copies of which are made available to the public in reasonable quantities\",[1] though the organisation does not define \"reasonable quantities\".National groups and affiliate bodies include SNEP in France; BVMI in Germany; RIAJ in Japan; BPI in the UK; RIAA in the US; ARIA in Australia; Music Canada; AMPROFON in Mexico; Recorded Music New Zealand; Promusicae in Spain; FIMI in Italy and others.[6] Record labels can be members of both their local industry body and IFPI.Members of the international phonographic industry formed IFPI at the industry's first international congress in Rome, Italy, held from 10\u201314 November 1933.[7] IFPI described its mission as representing \"the interests of the recording industry worldwide in all fora\"[8] by promoting legislation and copyrights[9] and \"to protect the largely British-based recording industry\" by promoting a global performance right in gramophone sound recordings.[10]The IFPI lobbied at the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations of 1961, which established an international standard for the protection of sound recordings, live performances and broadcasts. This Convention was opposed by trade groups representing authors and composers, who were concerned that establishing such \"neighbouring rights\" would undermine their own control over how their works were used and would result in prohibitively expensive licensing.[11] Pressure from United States-based broadcasters who didn't want to license the records they broadcast, among other factors, kept the United States from signing the Convention; the United States would not recognise a separate sound recording copyright until 1971.[12]In an effort to combat copyright violation, in 1971, the IFPI advocated for the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms (the Geneva Phonograms Convention), which 72 countries signed.[13]In 1986, the ISO established the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) standard, ISO 3901. In 1989, the IFPI was designated the registration authority for ISRC codes. ISRC codes \"enable the use of copyright protected recordings and works to be controlled; facilitate the distribution and collection of royalties (performances, private copying); and assist in the fight against piracy\".[14]To further combat infringement of recorded works, the IFPI and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced Source Identification (SID) codes in 1994. The SID codes are markings on optical discs such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) that identify the manufacturer, equipment, and master discs used to create each disc. There are two codes: the SID mastering code and the SID mould code. The SID mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced. The SID mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded (replicated). Since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities have the ability to both produce master discs and replicate discs, the SID mastering code and SID mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility.[15]:\u200a3,\u200a4SID codes follow a standard format consisting of the letters \"IFPI\" followed by four or five hexadecimal digits. A number prefaced with \"L\" is a \"mastering code\", a serial number taken from a pool assigned by Philips to the manufacturer. The mastering code identifies the Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or a glass master disc from which moulds are produced. Non-\"L\" numbers are \"mould codes\", which identify the manufacturer that replicated the disc. Phillips assigns the first 2 or 3 digits of the mould code and the remaining digits are a serial number assigned by that plant to its moulds.[15]:\u200a4,\u200a7In mid-October 2007, after IFPI let the ifpi.com domain registration lapse, ownership of the ifpi.com domain was transferred to The Pirate Bay, a group which claimed it received the domain from an anonymous donor.[16] The group set up a Website under the domain titled \"International Federation of Pirates Interests\", a replacement backronym for IFPI. Ownership of the domain was returned to IFPI in late November, when a WIPO arbitration panel concluded that \"the Disputed Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark in which the [IFPI] has rights\" and that the Pirate Bay's representative \"registered and [was] using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith\" and failed to adequately rebut IFPI's contention that he \"has no rights or a legitimate interest in the Disputed Domain Name\".[17] The organisation's website www.ifpi.org was unaffected during the dispute.IFPI publishes three annual top-ten charts: Global Artist, Global Top Digital Single, and Global Top Album.Launched in January 2014,[22] the IFPI Global Artist Chart was the first global chart to accurately capture the popularity of artists across streaming channels, alongside digital and physical album and singles sales. The independently verified[29] chart includes sales of albums across digital, CD and vinyl formats; singles, both downloaded and physical; and streams across the calendar year. The chart includes all the music of each artist featured, not just one track or album. It uses album equivalent units to combine measurements of downloads, physical sales and streams.The Top 10 Global Artist Chart is published each year, with the number-one artist being presented with a physical award, as the Global Recording Artist of the Year. The winners have been: One Direction in 2013,[22] Taylor Swift in 2014,[30] Adele in 2015,[31] Drake in 2016,[32] Ed Sheeran in 2017,[33] Drake in 2018,[29] Swift in 2019,[34] and BTS in 2020[35] and 2021.[36]The IFPI also publishes a list of the top 10 best-performing global singles and albums each year. The most recent winners, for 2021, were The Weeknd's \"Save Your Tears\"[37] and Adele's 30[38] respectively. In March 2021, the organisation introduced its newly launched Global Album All Format Chart, which ranks the best-selling albums of the year across all consumption formats, spanning physical sales, digital downloads, and streaming platforms. The winner of the inaugural chart for 2020 was BTS's Map of the Soul: 7.[39]Formerly, IFPI ran certifications called the IFPI Platinum Europe Awards and the IFPI Middle East Awards. The IFPI Platinum Europe Awards were founded in 1996.[18] They are awarded for actual retail sales (as opposed to shipments) of one million albums, in one of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom.[40] The IFPI Middle East Awards were established in October 2009.[18] They were awarded for sales in either Lebanon or the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In the GCC, gold certification was awarded for sales of 3,000 units and platinum for sales of 6,000 units. In Lebanon, gold certification was awarded for sales of 1,000 units and platinum for sales of 2,000 units.[41]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/64th_Annual_Grammy_Awards": "The 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022.[2] It recognized the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the eligibility year, running from September 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021.[3] The nominations were revealed via a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021. The performers for the ceremony were announced on March 15, 24, and 30, 2022. South African comedian Trevor Noah, who hosted the previous ceremony in 2021, returned as host.[4] The ceremony's location marked the first time the Recording Academy switched host cities for a single ceremony.[5]Jon Batiste received the most nominations with eleven, followed by Doja Cat, H.E.R., and Justin Bieber with eight each.[6] Batiste received the most awards with five, and won Album of the Year for We Are. Silk Sonic won Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Leave the Door Open\", and Olivia Rodrigo won Best New Artist.[7] The ceremony was originally scheduled for January 31, 2022, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles; however, on January 5, 2022, the Recording Academy postponed the ceremony indefinitely due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Omicron variant.[8] On January 18, 2022, the ceremony was rescheduled to April 3, 2022, and its location was moved to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, due to resultant scheduling conflicts with the Crypto.com Arena.[5]The nominations were announced during a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021, by Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr., alongside Jon Batiste, Billie Eilish, Finneas O'Connell, H.E.R., BTS, M\u00e5neskin, Tayla Parx, Carly Pearce, comedian Nate Bargatze, Recording Academy chair Tammy Hurt, and CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King.[9] The academy announced Trevor Noah to return as the host of the ceremony.[10]For the 2022 ceremony, the academy announced several changes for different categories and rules:[3]For the 2022 ceremony, the Recording Academy opted to eliminate its nomination review committees, which were previously responsible for determining the nominees of each category. Nominees would be solely decided based on votes from the Recording Academy.[11]For the 2022 ceremony and during both voting rounds, the number of categories members of the Recording Academy were allowed to vote in was reduced to ten, on top of the four major categories. The ten categories could belong to up to three different fields, including the genre fields.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Teen_pop": "Teen pop is a subgenre of pop music that is created, marketed and oriented towards preteens and teenagers.[1][7] Teen pop incorporates different subgenres of pop music,[7] as well as R&B, dance, electronic, hip hop and rock,[1][2] while the music of girl groups, boy bands, and acts like Britney Spears, is sometimes referred to as pure pop.[8][9] Typical characteristics of teen pop music include autotuned vocals, choreographed dancing, emphasis on visual appeal (photogenic faces, unique body physiques, immaculate hair styles and fashion clothes),[4] lyrics focused on love, relationships,[4] dancing, partying, friendship, puppy love (also known as a \"crush\")[10] and repeated chorus lines.[10] Its lyrics also incorporate sexual innuendo.[10] Teen pop singers often cultivate an image of a girl next door/boy next door.[4]According to AllMusic, teen pop \"is essentially dance-pop, pop, and urban ballads\" that are marketed to teens, and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s, pointing out the late 1990s as \"arguably the style's golden era.\"[1] About.com's Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as \"a simple, straightforward, ultra-catchy melody line [...] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres, but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop. The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners.\"[7]In Crazy About You: Reflections on the Meanings of Contemporary Teen Pop Music (2002), Phillip Vannini and Scott M. Myers write that teen pop songs \"are targeted to youths presumably unaware and unconcerned with the problems of everyday society. Youths are symbolized as mainly in growing up while having a good time.\"[10] Some authors deemed teen pop music as \"more disposable, less intellectually challenging, more feminine, simpler and more commercially focused than other musical forms.\"[4] In Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual, author Melanie Lowe wrote that teen pop \"is marked by a clash of presumed innocence and overt sexuality, a conflict that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil of its primary target audience and vital fan base: early-adolescent middle-and upper middle-class suburban girls.\"[11]Teen-oriented popular music had become common by the end of the swing era, in the late 1940s, with Frank Sinatra being an early teen idol.[4] However, it was the early 1960s that became known as the \"golden age\" for pop teen idols, who included Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Lulu and Ricky Nelson.[7] During the 1970s, one of the most popular preteen and teen-oriented acts was the Osmonds,[7] where family members Donny and Marie both enjoyed individual success as well as success as a duo apart from the main family (Donny also recorded with his brothers as the Osmonds).The first major wave of teen pop after the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s occurred in the mid to late 1980s, with artists such as Menudo, New Edition, the Jets, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Martika, New Kids on the Block[1][7] and Kylie Minogue.[12] In the early 1990s, teen pop dominated the charts until grunge and gangsta rap crossed over into the mainstream in North America by late 1991. Teen pop remained popular in the United Kingdom with the boy band Take That during this period, until the mid-1990s when Britpop became the next major wave in the UK, eclipsing the style similar to how grunge did in North America.[1]In 1996, British girl group Spice Girls released their debut single \"Wannabe\", which made them major pop stars in the UK, as well as in the US the following year. In their wake, other teen pop groups and singers rose to prominence, including Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Robyn, All Saints, S Club 7, Five, B*Witched, and Destiny's Child.[1][7] In 1999, the success of teenaged pop singers Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore marked the development of what AllMusic refers to as the \"pop Lolita\" trend,[1][7] sparking the short careers of upcoming pop singers such as Willa Ford, Brooke Allison, Samantha Mumba, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mikaila, Amanda, Nikki Cleary and Kaci Battaglia. \nIn 2001, artists like Aaron Carter, Swedish group A-Teens, girl groups 3LW, Play, Eden's Crush and Dream and boy bands O-Town, B2K and Dream Street were teen pop artists who achieved success. In Latin America, successful singers and bands appealing to tweens and teens were Sandy & Junior,[13] RBD[14] and Rouge.[15]\nAccording to Gayle Ward, the demise of this late 1990s teen pop was due to:1990s and early 2000s teen pop artists eventually entered hiatuses and semi-retirements (*NSYNC, Dream, Destiny's Child) or changed their musical style, including the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, 3LW and Aaron Carter.[7] Many teen artists starting incorporating genres such as pop rock, contemporary R&B and hip-hop. B2K were a hip hop/pop/R&B group consisting of four teenage black boys, and were considered a boy band, though they were only active from 2000 to 2004. Their style of music was very different than other teenage artists, sounding more mature than the typical boy band, though all members were in their mid-teenage years at the time.In the mid to late 2000s, teenage singers such as Rihanna and Chris Brown achieved success, indicating new relevance of teen-oriented pop music.[7]In 2005, AKB48 was created to promote idol culture and Japanese pop nationwide and overseas followed by the expansion of sister groups and rival groups locally and internationally over the years. In 2016, SNH48, as AKB48's second international sister group, announced its local Chinese sister groups like BEJ48, GNZ48, SHY48 and CKG48 to integrate idol culture with a Chinese twist.The emergence of Canadian singer Justin Bieber created a renewed interest in teen pop, especially of the traditional male teen idol. With the release of his debut seven-track EP My World on December 5, 2009, he became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[17] Since his debut, Bieber has played a key role in influencing modern popular culture and has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[18][19]In 2010, the creation of Ark Music Factory helped contributed a new generation of teen pop artists via the Internet, such as Rebecca Black and Jenna Rose, despite major criticism with these artists due to the excessive use of auto-tune. As for Japanese teen pop culture, the category of \"idol\" was playing an important role. Momoiro Clover Z is ranked as number one among female idol groups according to 2013\u20132017 surveys.[20]By the late 2010s, K-pop artists such as BTS and Blackpink, attained international stardom in teen pop culture.[21] Having sold over 4.7 million copies, Map of the Soul: 7 by BTS is the all-time best-selling album in South Korea. BTS is the first Asian and non-English-speaking act to be named International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020).[22] The group was featured on Time's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\" in 2018 and are recognised as the \"Princes of Pop\".[23]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Bubblegum_music": "Bubblegum (also called bubblegum pop) is pop music in a catchy and upbeat style that is considered disposable, contrived, or marketed for children and adolescents.[11] The term also refers to a pop subgenre, originating in the United States in the late 1960s, that evolved from garage rock, novelty songs, and the Brill Building sound, and which was also defined by its target demographic of preteens and young teenagers. The Archies' 1969 hit \"Sugar, Sugar\" was a representative example that led to cartoon rock, a short-lived trend of Saturday-morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop rock songs in the bubblegum vein.Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz claimed credit for coining \"bubblegum\", saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\"[3] The term was then popularized by their boss, Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart.Most bubblegum acts were one-hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the sound remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Commentators often debate the scope of the genre and have variously argued for the exclusion or inclusion of dance-pop, disco, teen pop, boy bands, and especially the Monkees. During the 1970s, the original bubblegum sound was a formative influence on punk rock, new wave, and melodic metal.Occasionally invoked as a pejorative,[3] the \"bubblegum\" descriptor has several different applications.[11] The 2001 book Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth rules out teen pop or boy bands as inherently bubblegum and defines the term as:The artists were typically singles acts, with songs commonly featuring sing-along choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual double entendre.[3] Comparing bubblegum to power pop, Mojo writer Dawn Eden said: \"Power pop aims for your heart and your feet. Bubblegum aims for any part of your body it can get, as long as you buy the damn record.\"[3] Music critic Lester Bangs described the style as \"the basic sound of rock 'n' roll \u2013 minus the rage, fear, violence and anomie\".[12]There is debate concerning which artists fit the genre, especially for cases such as the Monkees.[3] In the opinion of music historian Bill Pitzonka: \"The whole thing that really makes a record bubblegum is just an inherently contrived innocence that somehow transcends that. [...] It has to sound like they mean it.\"[3] Music critic David Smay argued that disco is merely bubblegum by another name and that since bubblegum is \"dance music for pre-teen girls\", the genre's scope must therefore include dance-pop and such associated figures as Stock Aitken Waterman and Kylie Minogue, but \"Not all dance-pop is aimed at kids and shouldn't be presumed to be disposable anymore than bubblegum.\"[5]According to music historian Carl Caferelli, \"You could conceivably think of virtually every cute novelty hit, from pre-rock ditties like \u201cHow Much Is That Doggie In The Window\u201d to transcendent rock-era staples like \u201cIko Iko,\u201d as a legitimate precursor to bubblegum's avowedly ephemeral themes.\"[3] He went on to list such \"important antecedents\" as \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\" (Herman's Hermits, 1965), \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\" (Royal Guardsmen, 1966), \"Ding, Dong! The Witch is Dead\" (The Fifth Estate, 1967), and \"Green Tambourine\" (Lemon Pipers, 1967).[3]Bubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 songs \"Simon Says\" by the 1910 Fruitgum Company and \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" by the Ohio Express.[3] Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz have claimed credit for coining \"bubblegum\" for this music, saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\"[3] The term was seized upon by Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart, as Pitzonka added: \"Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized [the scene] when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\"[3]The Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" became the best-selling hit of 1969 and inspired a wave of artists to adopt the bubblegum style.[12] The song's success led to \"cartoon rock\", a short-lived trend of Saturday morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop-rock songs in the bubblegum vein. However, none of these songs had showings on the pop charts when released as singles, except for a record early in the year, The Banana Splits theme song \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\", which managed a number 96 peak on the Billboard Top 100.[3]Most bubblegum acts were one hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the genre remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s.[13] Bubblegum failed to maintain its chart presence after the early 1970s due in part to changing trends in the industry. Producers such as  Kasenetz and Katz subsequently pursued different musical avenues.[3] Writing in Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth, Chuck Eddy offered that bubblegum evolved to be \"more an attitude than a genre\" during the 1970s.[14] In the UK, bubblegum caught on in the early 1970s and fell out of popular favor by the end of the decade.[12] In 2010, author and musician Bob Stanley summarized:While some more confrontational music would become popular with kids \u2013 some of the more colourful rave anthems, for example \u2013 kids' music became synonymous with novelty tie-ins like Bob the Builder and Mr Blobby until the explosion in kids' music, fuelled by the cross-promotional opportunities offered by the multiplicity of kids' TV channels, led by the Wiggles and the Disney stable.[12]Many musicians who grew up with the genre later incorporated bubblegum influences in their work.[13] Although it is rarely acknowledged by music critics, who typically dismissed the genre, bubblegum's simple song structures, upbeat tempos, and catchy hooks were carried into punk rock.[15] The Ramones were the most prominent of the bubblegum-influenced punk bands, adopting cartoon personae and later covering two bubblegum standards \"Little Bit O' Soul\" and \"Indian Giver\".[12] Pitzonka stated of bubblegum's legacy:Bubblegum really did lay a deeper foundation than anybody's willing to give it credit for. Yes, it is responsible for Take That and New Kids On The Block, but it's also responsible for The Ramones. A lot of the melodic metal comes out of that too. Bubblegum was based in melody; it was all about the song. It was all about getting the message across in two and a half minutes. [...] And it was the perfect antidote to everything that was going on [in the late 1960s].[3]The term \"bubblegum dance\" has sometimes been used to describe music that has characteristics of bubblegum pop and dance music, especially dance-pop. The 1971 Osmonds song \"One Bad Apple\" is an early example.[16][verification needed] Bubblegum dance also can refer to a Eurodance subgenre that emerged in the mid-90s.[17][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Alanis_Morissette": "Alanis Nadine Morissette (/\u0259\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0n\u026as \u02ccm\u0252r\u026a\u02c8s\u025bt/ \u0259-LAH-niss MORR-ih-SET; born June 1, 1974) is a  Canadian-American[1] singer, songwriter, and actress. Known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting, Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s with two highly successful dance-pop albums.[2][3][4] Afterward, as part of a recording deal, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. In 1995, she released Jagged Little Pill, an alt rock-oriented album with the elements of post-grunge, which sold more than 33 million copies globally and is her most critically acclaimed work to date.[5][6][7][8] This earned her the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1996 and was made into a rock musical of the same name in 2017, which earned 15 Tony Award nominations including Best Musical. The album was also listed in the 2003 and 2020 editions of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time Guide.[9] Her highly anticipated, more experimental follow-up, electronic-infused album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998.Morissette assumed creative control and producing duties for her subsequent studio albums, including Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), and Havoc and Bright Lights (2012). Her latest album, Such Pretty Forks in the Road, was released in 2020. Her well-known singles \"You Oughta Know\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Head Over Feet\", \"Uninvited\", \"Thank U\" and \"Hands Clean\" reached top 40 in the major charts around the world, including 10 top-40 hits in the UK, 3 top-10 in the US and Australia and 12 top-10 hits in her native Canada. She also holds the record of the most No. 1s on the weekly Billboard Alternative Songs chart among any female soloist, group leader or duo member.[10] Morissette won 7 Grammy Awards, 14 Juno Awards, 1 Brit Award and  has sold more than 75 million records worldwide and has been dubbed the \"Queen of Alt-Rock Angst\" by Rolling Stone.[11][12][13][14]Morissette was born June 1, 1974, at Riverside Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada[15][16] to teacher Georgia Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Feuerstein) of Hungarian descent and high-school principal and French teacher Alan Richard Morissette.[17] She has two brothers: older brother Chad is a business entrepreneur,[18] and twin brother (12 minutes older) Wade Morissette is a musician.[19][20] Her father is of French and Irish descent, whereas her mother has Hungarian and Jewish ancestry.[21][22] Her parents were teachers in a military school and due to their work often had to move. Between the ages of three and six she lived with her parents in Lahr (Black Forest), Germany.[23]When she was six years old, she returned to Ottawa and started to play the piano. In 1981, at the age of seven, she began dance lessons.[24][25][26] Morissette had a Catholic upbringing.[27] She attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school[28] and Immaculata High School for Grades 7 and 8[29] before completing the rest of her high school at Glebe Collegiate Institute.[30] She appeared on the children's television sketch comedy You Can't Do That on Television for five episodes when she was in junior high school.[31]Morissette recorded her first demo called \"Fate Stay with Me\", produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, engineered by Rich Dodson of Canadian classic rock band The Stampeders.[32] A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to Geffen Records, but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label's headquarters in October 1989.In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette's debut album, Alanis, in Canada only. Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum,[33] and its first single, \"Too Hot\", reached the top 20 on the RPM singles chart. Subsequent singles \"Walk Away\" and \"Feel Your Love\" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada;[34] comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice.[35] Morissette was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won),[36] Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for \"Too Hot\").[37]In 1992, she released her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics.[34] Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9. She said of the album, \"People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it ... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one.\"[35] As with Alanis (1991), Now Is the Time (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles\u2014\"An Emotion Away\", the minor adult contemporary hit \"No Apologies\" as well as \"(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time\". The industry considered it a commercial failure, however, since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album.[34][38] With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.In 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch.[39] Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her \"spectacular voice\", her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living at home with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people.[39] After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto.[34] Her publisher funded part of her development and when she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, he believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio.[34][39] The two wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, Jagged Little Pill, and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records. In the same year she learned how to play guitar. According to manager Welch, every label they approached, apart from Maverick, declined to sign Morissette.[39]Maverick Records released Jagged Little Pill internationally in 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing \"You Oughta Know\", the album's first single, featuring Flea and Dave Navarro.[40] The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics,[34] and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic.After the success of \"You Oughta Know\", the album's other hits helped send Jagged Little Pill to the top of the charts. \"All I Really Want\" and \"Hand in My Pocket\" followed, and the fourth U.S. single, \"Ironic\", became Morissette's biggest hit. \"You Learn\" and \"Head over Feet\", the fifth and sixth singles, kept Jagged Little Pill (1995) in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for more than a year. Jagged Little Pill sold more than 16 million copies in the U.S.; it sold 33 million worldwide,[41] making it the second biggest-selling album by a female artist (behind Shania Twain's Come On Over).[42][43]Morissette's popularity grew significantly in Canada, where the album was certified twelve times platinum[33] and produced four RPM chart-toppers: \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", and \"Head over Feet\". The album was also a bestseller in Australia and the United Kingdom.[44][45]Morissette's success with Jagged Little Pill (1995) was credited with opening doors for female singers such as Tracy Bonham, Fiona Apple, Meredith Brooks, Shakira, Pink, Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne and Florence Welch.[46] She was criticized for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Ballard, and her previous disco pop albums also proved a hindrance for her respectability.[34][47] Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year (\"You Oughta Know\"), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album.[48] At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996, she won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for \"You Oughta Know\"), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.[49]Following the album release in 1995, Morissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour's drummer. Radiohead joined as an opening act in the summer of 1996.[50] \"Ironic\" was nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards\u2014Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form[51]\u2014and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where Morissette also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award.[52] The video Jagged Little Pill, Live, which was co-directed by Morissette and chronicled the bulk of her tour, won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.[53]Following the tour, Morissette began practicing Iyengar Yoga for balance. After the last December 1996 show, she went to India for six weeks, accompanied by her mother, two aunts and two friends.[54] The trip left her with indelible impression and set the cornerstone for the concept of her next album.[55]Morissette was featured as a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr's cover of \"Drift Away\" on his 1998 album, Vertical Man, and on the songs \"Don't Drink the Water\" and \"Spoon\" on the Dave Matthews Band album Before These Crowded Streets. She recorded the song \"Uninvited\" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.[56] Later in 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which she wrote and produced with Glen Ballard.The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release;[57] instead, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies\u2014a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist.[58] The wordy, personal lyrics on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than Jagged Little Pill (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx.[34][59] However, it received positive reviews, including a four-star review from Rolling Stone.[60] In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum.[33][61] \"Thank U\", the album's only major international hit single, was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy.[57][62] Morissette herself directed the videos for \"Unsent\" and \"So Pure\", which won, respectively, the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Director and the Juno Award for Video of the Year.[61][63]Morissette contributed vocals to \"Mercy\", where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian, \"Hope\", \"Innocence\" and \"Faith\", four tracks on Jonathan Elias's project The Prayer Cycle, which was released in 1999. The same year, she released the live acoustic album Alanis Unplugged, which was recorded during her appearance on the television show MTV Unplugged. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including \"King of Pain\" (a cover of The Police song) and \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie track \"That I Would Be Good\", released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song \"Are You Still Mad\" on the charity album Live in the X Lounge II. For her live rendition of \"So Pure\" at Woodstock '99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards.[64] During summer 1999, Morissette toured with singer-songwriter Tori Amos on the 5 and a Half Weeks Tour in support of Amos' album To Venus and Back (1999).In 2001, Morissette was featured with Stephanie McKay on the Tricky song \"Excess\", which is on his album Blowback. Morissette released her fifth studio album, Under Rug Swept, in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from Eric Avery, Dean DeLeo, Flea, and Meshell Ndegeocello.Under Rug Swept debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S.[33][65] It produced the hit single \"Hands Clean\", which topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received substantial radio play; for her work on \"Hands Clean\" and \"So Unsexy\", Morissette won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year.[66] A second single, \"Precious Illusions\", was released, but it did not garner significant success outside Canada or U.S. hot AC radio.Later in 2002, Morissette released the combination package Feast on Scraps, which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the Under Rug Swept recording sessions. Preceded by the single \"Simple Together\", it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year.[65][67]Morissette hosted the Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson's breast-flash incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[68] Morissette released her sixth studio album, So-Called Chaos, in May 2004.[30] She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S.[65] The lead single, \"Everything\", achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word \"asshole\", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word \"nightmare\" instead.[68] Two other singles, \"Out Is Through\" and \"Eight Easy Steps\", fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of \"Eight Easy Steps\" was a U.S. club hit. Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies, working with the non-profit environmental organization Reverb.[69]To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Jagged Little Pill (1995), Morissette released a studio acoustic version, Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through Starbucks' Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV North America, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale.[70][71] As of November\u00a02010[update], Jagged Little Pill Acoustic had sold 372,000 copies in the U.S.,[65] and a video for \"Hand in My Pocket\" received rotation on VH1 in America. The accompanying tour ran for two months in mid-2005, with Morissette playing small theatre venues. During the same period, Morissette was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.[72] The singer opened for The Rolling Stones for a few dates of their A Bigger Bang Tour in the autumn of 2005.[73]Morissette released the greatest hits album Alanis Morissette: The Collection in late 2005.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Fiona_Apple": "Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter. She has released five albums from 1996 to 2020, which have all reached the top 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart.[7] Apple has received numerous awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and a Billboard Music Award.The youngest daughter of the actor Brandon Maggart, Apple was born in New York City and was raised alternating between her mother's home in New York and her father's in Los Angeles. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, Tidal, containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"Criminal\". She followed with When the Pawn... (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified Platinum.For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest Epic Records, erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified Gold, and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, The Idler Wheel..., which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2013. Apple's fifth studio album, Fetch the Bolt Cutters, was released in 2020 to widespread acclaim, earning two Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Performance for the lead single \"Shameika\".Fiona Apple was born Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart on September 13, 1977, in New York City to singer Diane McAfee and actor Brandon Maggart, who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical Applause.[8][9] Her father is from Tennessee, and through him, Apple has Melungeon ancestry.[10] Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and big band vocalist Johnny McAfee. Her sister, Amber, sings cabaret under the stage name Maude Maggart, and actor Garett Maggart is her half brother. Apple grew up in Morningside Gardens in Harlem[11] with her mother and sister, but spent summers with her father in Los Angeles, California.[12]Apple was classically trained on piano as a child, and began composing her own pieces by the age of eight.[12] When learning to play piano, she would often take sheet music and translate guitar tablature into the corresponding notes.[12] Apple later began to play along with jazz standard compositions after becoming proficient, through which she discovered Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, who became major influences on her.[13]Since childhood, Apple has struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety, and has also been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.[14] At age 12, she was raped outside the apartment she shared with her mother, step-father, and sister in Harlem.[15] She subsequently developed an eating disorder, purposely slimming her developing body, which she saw as \"bait\" for potential predators.[15] \"I definitely did have an eating disorder,\" she recalled. \"What was really frustrating for me was that everyone thought I was anorexic, and I wasn't. I was just really depressed and self-loathing.\"[15] She also described how her OCD had a significant impact on her eating habits, by requiring food to be a certain color or shape.[10][15]After the rape, Apple began attending Model Mugging classes, practicing self-defense,[14] but continued to suffer panic attacks while walking home from school, which led to her relocating to Los Angeles to live with her father for one year.[10] In Los Angeles, Apple attended Alexander Hamilton High School for her second year.[16][17]In a 2000 interview, Apple stated that, despite speculation from journalists, she did not write songs about the trauma surrounding her rape: \"It doesn't get into the writing. It's a boring pain. It's such a fuckin' old pain that, you know, there's nothing poetic about it.\"[18]Apple was introduced to the music industry in 1994, when she gave a demo tape containing the songs \"Never Is a Promise\", \"Not One of Those Times\", and \"He Takes a Taxi\" to her friend who was the babysitter for music publicist Kathryn Schenker.[19] Schenker then passed the tape along to Sony Music executive Andy Slater.[20] Apple's abilities captured his attention, and Slater signed her to a record deal.[21][22]In 1996, Apple's debut album, Tidal, was released by Work Records and Columbia Records.[15] The record was largely inspired by Apple's recent breakup with her first boyfriend.[15] The album sold 2.7\u00a0million copies and was certified three times Platinum in the U.S.[23][24] \"Criminal\", the third single, became a hit and the song reached the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song's controversial Mark Romanek-directed music video played on MTV.[25] Other singles from Tidal included \"Shadowboxer\", \"Sleep to Dream\", and \"Never Is a Promise\". Apple accepted the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards for her song \"Sleep to Dream\", during her acceptance speech she said:This world is bullshit. And you shouldn't model your life\u2014wait a second\u2014you shouldn't model your life about what you think that we think is cool and what we're wearing and what we're saying and everything. Go with yourself.[26]Apple responded to criticisms of her acceptance speech in Rolling Stone in January 1998, stating, \"When I have something to say, I'll say it.\"[15] During this period, Apple also covered the Beatles' \"Across the Universe\" and Percy Mayfield's \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\" for the soundtrack of the film Pleasantville. She later canceled the last 21 dates on a tour in support of her album due to \"personal family problems\".[27] In 1997, Apple met director Paul Thomas Anderson during a photoshoot, and the two began a relationship that lasted several years.[28]Apple's second album, When the Pawn..., was released in 1999. Its full title is a poem Apple wrote after reading letters that appeared in Spin regarding an article that had cast her in a negative light in an earlier issue.[29] The title's length earned it a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for 2001. However, as of October 2007, it no longer has the longest album title, as Soulwax released Most of the Remixes, a remix album whose title surpasses When the Pawn's length by 100 characters.[30] When the Pawn was cultivated during Apple's relationship with film director Paul Thomas Anderson. When the Pawn, which was produced by Jon Brion, used more expressive lyrics, experimented more with drum loops, and incorporated both the Chamberlin and drummer Matt Chamberlain.[31] The album received a positive reception from publications such as Rolling Stone.[32] It did not fare as well commercially as her debut, though it was an RIAA-certified Platinum album[23] and sold one million copies in the U.S.[24] The album's lead single, \"Fast as You Can\", reached the top twenty on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart and became Apple's first Top 40 hit in the UK. The videos for two follow-up singles, \"Paper Bag\" and \"Limp\" (directed by then-boyfriend Anderson), received very little play.In a February 2000 set hampered by equipment issues to 3,000 audience members at the New York City Roseland Ballroom, a frustrated Apple left the stage without returning. Her performance saw Apple appearing distraught at the sound quality, apologizing numerous times for the sound and crying.[33] After completing a concert tour in support of her second album in 2000, Apple relocated to Los Angeles,[34] where she still resides as of 2020.[14]During her hiatus, Apple contemplated retiring from her recording career. Apple sang with Johnny Cash on a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" that ended up on his album American IV: The Man Comes Around and was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\". She also collaborated with Cash on Cat Stevens's \"Father and Son\", which was included in his 2003 collection Unearthed.Apple's third album, Extraordinary Machine, was originally produced by Jon Brion. In spring 2002, Apple and Brion, her longtime friend and producer on When the Pawn, met for their weekly lunch meeting. Brion reportedly \"begged\" Apple to make another album. Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, Epic Records, with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. Recording sessions began in 2002, at Ocean Way studios in Nashville, Tennessee, but later moved to the Paramour Mansion in Los Angeles. Work on the album continued until 2003, and in May of that year it was submitted to Sony executives. In 2004 and 2005, tracks were leaked on the Internet in MP3 format and played on U.S. and international radio. Subsequently, MP3s of the entire album went online. Although a website distributing the album was quickly shut down, it soon reached P2P networks and was downloaded by fans.[35] A fan-led campaign supported the album's official release.Mike Elizondo, who had previously played bass on Pawn, was brought back as co-producer to complete the tracks he had begun with Brion and Apple. Spin later reported the following: \"Fans erroneously thought that Apple's record label, Epic, had rejected the first version of Extraordinary Machine...\u00a0in reality, according to Elizondo, Apple was unhappy with the results, and it was her decision to redo the record, not her label's.\"[35] In August 2005, the album was given an October release date.[35] Production had been largely redone \"from scratch\" by Elizondo and was co-produced by Brian Kehew. Two of the 11 previous leaked tracks were relatively unchanged, and one new song was also included.[36] Despite suggestions that the album had caused a rift between Brion and Apple, they regularly perform together at Largo, a club in Los Angeles, including a joint appearance with Elizondo on bass just before the news broke of an official release.[37] Extraordinary Machine debuted at number seven and was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\". It was eventually certified Gold,[23] though its singles (\"Parting Gift\", \"O' Sailor\", \"Not About Love\", and \"Get Him Back\") failed to enter any Billboard charts.[38] Apple went on a live tour to promote the album in late 2005.Beginning in the mid-2000s, Apple dated writer and television creator Jonathan Ames.[39][40][41]In June 2006, Apple appeared on the joke track \"Come Over and Get It (Up in 'Dem Guts)\" by comedian Zach Galifianakis. Galifianakis previously appeared in the music video for Apple's \"Not About Love\".[42] Apple recorded a cover of \"Sally's Song\" for the 2006 special edition release of the soundtrack for the Tim Burton film The Nightmare Before Christmas. In May 2006, Apple paid tribute to Elvis Costello on VH1's concert series Decades Rock Live, by performing Costello's hit \"I Want You\". Her version was subsequently released as a digital single.[43] Apple toured the East Coast during August 2007, with Nickel Creek.[44][45] In 2008, Apple recorded a duet titled \"Still I\" with Christophe Deluy. In 2009, Apple covered \"Why Try to Change Me Now\" and \"I Walk A Little Faster\" for The Best Is Yet to Come \u2013 The Songs of Cy Coleman.In January 2010, Fiona Apple and Jon Brion performed together at \"Love and Haiti, Too: A Music Benefit\", a charity concert for the people hurt by the Haiti earthquake. Fiona sang a cover of \"(S)he's Funny That Way\", composed by Neil Moret, lyrics by Richard Whiting, which is often associated with the singer Billie Holiday. In June 2010, Fiona released a song titled \"So Sleepy\", produced by Jon Brion and written by children involved with the non-profit organization 826LA. The song was included on a compilation album released by the organization titled Chickens in Love. Apple collaborated with Margaret Cho on her album Cho Dependent, which was released on August 24, 2010.[46]In late 2010, Billboard published an article stating that Apple was planning on releasing a new album in spring 2011, with musician Michelle Branch claiming to have heard some of the new tracks.[47] Drummer Charley Drayton also told Modern Drummer magazine that he was co-producing the record.[48] However, the album was not released in the spring and Billboard reported later that Epic was not aware of a record.[49] Apple delayed the album's release until 2012, explaining that she was waiting \"until her label found a new president and that she didn't want her work to be mishandled amid corporate disarray.\"[50] In January 2012, after its new record label head, LA Reid hinted at new music from Apple, Epic Records announced that the album would be released later in the year.[51] Apple announced performances at the South by Southwest Festival and a spring 2012 tour soon after.[52]The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do,[53][54] Apple's fourth studio album, was released on June 19, 2012, in the United States.[55] It became Apple's most successful album on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number three,[56] and received critical acclaim.[57] According to an article in American Songwriter, \"The Idler Wheel isn't always pretty, but it pulses with life, brutal and true.\"[58]While promoting The Idler Wheel, Apple revealed in a June 2012 interview that she had briefly married an unnamed French photographer, later revealed to be Lionel Deluy, \"for complicated reasons\" and had a passing liaison with a younger woman.[59][8] She subsequently gave an in-depth interview on Marc Maron's WTF podcast in July, in which she described her experience with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder throughout her adult life.[10] She also divulged that she had recently decided to quit drinking.[10] On September 19, 2012, Apple was arrested at an internal U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas, and charged with possession of hashish, detaining her en route to a concert in Austin, Texas, at the Hudspeth County Jail.[60][61]Apple contributed a previously unreleased song entitled \"Dull Tool\" to the soundtrack of the 2012 Judd Apatow film This Is 40.[62] Another song was recorded for the film but was not used, ending up as the track \"Cosmonauts\" on her 2020 album Fetch the Bolt Cutters.[63][64] In November 2012, Apple wrote a letter to her fans \u2013 a scan of which was posted to her website and her Facebook page \u2013 postponing the South American leg of her tour due to the health of her dog, Janet. According to the letter, the dog has Addison's disease and has had a tumor \"idling in her chest\" for two years.[65]In September 2013, a Chipotle ad appeared online with a soundtrack of Apple covering \"Pure Imagination\" from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The video, which follows a scarecrow as he discovers the truth about factory farming and processed food, was described as \"haunted,\" \"dystopian,\" \"bizarre,\" and \"beautiful.\"[66][67]\nIn 2014, Apple wrote the opening theme, \"Container\", for the Showtime drama series The Affair.[68] During 2014, Apple also appeared at a number of performances by Blake Mills, including in New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts, during his tour in support of his second full-length album, Heigh Ho.

This was considered in response to Grammy head Neil Portnow's heavily criticized comments that women need to \"step up\" to earn more Grammy nods.[71]In January 2019, Apple collaborated with King Princess on a version of her 1999 song \"I Know\". The song was released for Spotify's RISE program on January 25.[72] Apple was featured in the documentary and soundtrack for Echo in the Canyon with Jakob Dylan covering songs by artists such as the Beach Boys and the Byrds.[73] In November, she covered \"Whole of the Moon,\" a Waterboys song, for the series finale of Showtime's The Affair.[74][75]In two Instagram posts in March 2019, Apple hinted at the recording of a fifth album.[76] In a September 2019 interview with Vulture, she confirmed that the album was in its final stages, recorded with a band and planned for an early 2020 release.[28] In a follow-up interview with Vulture in January 2020, she said her new album would likely be out \"in a few months.\"[77] On March 8, 2020, Apple posted a video showcasing her saying \"M-Y-R-E-C-O-R-D-I-S-D-O-N-E\" in fingerspelling.[14] In an interview with The New Yorker, it was announced that Apple's fifth studio album was to be titled Fetch the Bolt Cutters.[14] The album, which consists of 13 self-produced tracks, was released digitally on April 17, 2020.[78] The album was met with widespread acclaim by music critics.[79] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, the album won Best Alternative Music Album and the lead single \"Shameika\" won Best Rock Performance.[80]On June 17, 2020, Apple was confirmed as an additional musician featuring on Bob Dylan's 39th album Rough and Rowdy Ways,[81] playing piano on the track \"Murder Most Foul\".

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)": "Anne Erin \"Annie\" Clark (born September 28, 1982), known professionally as St. Vincent, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, producer, screenwriter, actress, and director. Her music is noted for its complex arrangements, utilizing a wide array of instruments. St. Vincent is the recipient of various accolades, including three Grammy Awards.Raised in Dallas, Texas, St. Vincent began her music career as a member of the Polyphonic Spree. She was also a member of Sufjan Stevens's touring band before forming her own band in 2006. Her debut solo album, Marry Me, was released in 2007, followed by Actor (2009) and Strange Mercy (2011). In 2012, St. Vincent released Love This Giant, an album made in collaboration with David Byrne. Her fourth studio album, St. Vincent (2014), received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics. Her fifth album, Masseduction (2017), was released to further acclaim. St. Vincent's sixth album, Daddy's Home, was released in 2021.Besides music, St. Vincent has written and directed a segment in the 2017 anthology horror film XX. She also co-wrote and starred in the psychological thriller film The Nowhere Inn (2020).Clark was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 28, 1982.[1][2][3][4] Her mother is a social worker and administrator for a nonprofit organization, and her stepfather works in corporate tax administration. Her parents divorced when she was three, and when she was seven she moved with her mother and two older sisters to Dallas, Texas. She has said that a 23andMe DNA test revealed her ancestry to be 80% Irish and 20% Ashkenazi Jewish.[5][non-primary source needed] She was raised Catholic[6] and Unitarian Universalist.[7] She has four brothers and four sisters from her parents' blended families.[8][9]As a child, Clark was fond of Ritchie Valens and the movie La Bamba. When she was five, her mother gave her a red plastic guitar from a Target store for Christmas. She began playing her first real guitar at age 12 and worked some of her teenage years as a roadie for her aunt and uncle, the guitar-vocal jazz duo Tuck & Patti.[10][11] In 2001, she graduated from Lake Highlands High School, where she participated in theater and the school's jazz band, and was a classmate of actor Mark Salling.[12][13]She attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, studying with Professor Lauren Passarelli. She left after  three years, feeling that art institutions such as Berklee were sometimes focused more on the aesthetics of art than the product.[14] In retrospect, she said, \"I think that with music school and art school, or school in any form, there has to be some system of grading and measurement. The things they can teach you are quantifiable. While all that is good and has its place, at some point you have to learn all you can and then forget everything that you learned in order to actually start making music.\"[15]In 2003, Clark released an EP with fellow Berklee students entitled Ratsliveonnoevilstar.[16] She also worked with Heavy Rotation Records, where \"she revealed a much more private and intimate rendering of 'Count' for Dorm Sessions Vol. 1\"[17] and studied with Professor of Guitar Lauren Passarelli. Shortly after leaving Berklee, she returned home to Texas, where she joined the Polyphonic Spree just before they embarked on a European tour.[10] In 2004, she joined Glenn Branca's 100-guitar orchestra for the Queens performance,[18] and was also briefly in a noise-rock band called the Skull Fuckers.[19][20][21] Clark left the Polyphonic Spree and joined Sufjan Stevens' touring band in 2006. During this period she recorded and released an EP entitled Paris is Burning.In 2006, she began recording a studio album under the stage name St. Vincent. In an interview on The Colbert Report, she said that she \"took [her] moniker from a line in a Nick Cave song\" that referred to the hospital where Dylan Thomas died: \"And Dylan Thomas died drunk in / St. Vincent's hospital\" (from Cave's song \"There She Goes my Beautiful World\", from the album Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus). The name is also a reference to her great-grandmother, whose middle name was St. Vincent.[22]Clark released her debut album, Marry Me, on July 10, 2007 on Beggars Banquet Records. Named after a line from the television show Arrested Development,[23] it features appearances from drummer Brian Teasley (Man or Astro-man?, the Polyphonic Spree), Mike Garson (David Bowie's longtime pianist), and horn player Louis Schwadron (the Polyphonic Spree).The album was well received by critics, who compared Clark to the likes of Kate Bush and David Bowie,[24] and lauded the album for its arrangements, themes and style. In their review, The AV Club said: \"There's a point where too much happiness turns into madness, and St. Vincent's multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark knows this place well\".[25] Pitchfork said, \"At every turn Marry Me takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly sui generis vision into vibrant life.\"[24]The songs on Marry Me were written largely when Clark was 18 and 19 years old, and, she says, \"represented a more idealized version of what life was or what love was or anything in the eyes of someone who hadn't really experienced anything.\"[15] The album yielded one single, \"Paris Is Burning\", and a music video was produced for \"Jesus Saves, I Spend\".In 2008, Clark was nominated for three PLUG Independent Music Awards: New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Video of the Year. On March 6, 2008, she won the PLUG Female Artist of the Year award.[26]In 2008, after returning to New York from a lengthy tour, Clark began working on her second album. Her inspiration reportedly came from several films, including Disney movies: \"Well, the truth is that I had come back from a pretty long \u2014 you know, about a year-and-a-half of touring, and so my brain was sort of all circuit boards that were a little bit fried\", Clark said. \"So I started watching films as sort of a way to get back into being human. And then it started to just really inform the entire record.\"[27]Clark, who did not have a studio at the time, began writing the album in her apartment on her computer using GarageBand and MIDI, because she had gotten noise complaints from neighbors.[28] The songs were inspired largely by scenes from various children's films. Clark said she imagined soundtracks for certain scenes in films when writing the music and lyrics,[28] including scenes in Snow White (1937) and The Wizard of Oz (1939).Her second album, Actor, was released by 4AD Records on May 5, 2009.[29] It was also well received and gained more commercial attention than its predecessor.[15] Spin gave the album eight out of ten stars, noting its \"[juxtaposition of] the cruel and the kind, and here, the baroque arrangements are even more complex and her voice even prettier, with both only underlining the dark currents running through her songs\".[30] Entertainment Weekly said the album \"plays up the contrasts, [with Clark] letting her church-choir voice linger on lyrics that hint darkly at themes of violence, sex, and general chaos\", and branded it \"a uniquely potent cocktail of sounds and moods\".[31]Actor charted well for an independent release, peaking at No. 9 on Billboard's Independent Albums Chart, No. 5 on the Tastemaker Albums Chart,[32] and No. 90 on the Billboard 200. Although it spawned no singles (except in the UK, where \"Actor Out Of Work\" was issued as a 7\" vinyl single), music videos for \"Marrow\" and \"Actor Out of Work\" were released, and aired on several music channels. A promotional music video for \"Laughing With a Mouth of Blood\", featuring Portlandia's Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein (then of ThunderAnt), was also filmed.Two soundtracks for The Twilight Saga have featured Clark's songs. \"Roslyn\", in collaboration with Bon Iver, appeared on the 2009 soundtrack of New Moon; and \"The Antidote\" was written for and appeared on 2012's Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2.In November 2010, Clark appeared with American rappers Kid Cudi and Cage on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. They performed \"Maniac\" from Cudi's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which prominently samples \"The Strangers\", the opening song on Actor.[33]Clark spent much of her time in Seattle writing her third album, Strange Mercy, in October 2010. In an interview with Julie Klausner for Spin Magazine, she recalled: \"[Death Cab for Cutie drummer] Jason McGerr had an office that was closing. He offered me the space for a month, for all of October. I was alone. I stayed at the Ace Hotel downtown, in one of the rooms with a shared bathroom. I would just get up in the morning and caffeinate, and run, and go to the studio for 12 hours, come back, eat dinner alone with a book, have a glass of wine, and go to bed. And do it all over again.\"[34]On January 12, 2011, Clark announced via Twitter that she was working on Strange Mercy, a follow-up to Actor.[35][non-primary source needed]\nIn early March 2011, producer John Congleton, who also worked with Clark on Actor, said that he and Clark were nearly a third of the way through recording it.[36]On July 4, Clark stated via Twitter that if enough followers tweeted the hashtag \"#strangemercy\", she would release a track from the album.

She is a co-founder, lead vocalist, and the primary songwriter of the band No Doubt, whose singles include \"Just a Girl\", \"Spiderwebs\", and \"Don't Speak\", from their 1995 breakthrough studio album Tragic Kingdom, as well as \"Hey Baby\" and \"It's My Life\" from later albums.During the band's hiatus, Stefani embarked on a solo pop career in 2004 by releasing her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Inspired by pop music from the 1980s, the album was a critical and commercial success.[5][6] It spawned six singles, including \"What You Waiting For?\", \"Rich Girl\", \"Hollaback Girl\", and \"Cool\". \"Hollaback Girl\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while also becoming the first US download to sell one million copies.[7] In 2006, Stefani released her second studio album, The Sweet Escape. Among the singles were \"Wind It Up\" and \"The Sweet Escape\", the latter of which was number three on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart of 2007.[8] Her third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016), was her first solo album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Her fourth solo album and first full-length Christmas album, You Make It Feel Like Christmas, was released in 2017 and charted 19 tracks on Billboard's Holiday Digital Song Sales component chart in the United States. Stefani has released several singles with Blake Shelton, including \"Nobody but You\" (2020), which reached number 18 in the US.Stefani has won three Grammy Awards. As a solo artist, she has received an American Music Award, Brit Award, World Music Award, and two Billboard Music Awards. In 2003, she debuted her clothing line L.A.M.B. and expanded her collection with the 2005 Harajuku Lovers line, inspired by Japanese culture and fashion. Billboard magazine ranked Stefani the 54th most successful artist and 37th most successful Hot 100 artist of the 2000\u20132009 decade.[9][10] VH1 ranked her 13th on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012.[11] Including her work with No Doubt, Stefani has sold more than 30\u00a0million albums worldwide.[12]Gwen Ren\u00e9e Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, in Fullerton, California,[13] and raised Catholic in nearby Anaheim, California.[14] She was named after a stewardess in the 1968 novel Airport, and her middle name, Ren\u00e9e, comes from the Four Tops' 1968 version of the Left Banke's 1966 song \"Walk Away Ren\u00e9e\".[15] Her father Dennis Stefani is Italian-American and worked as a Yamaha marketing executive.[16] Her mother Patti (n\u00e9e Flynn[17]) is Irish-American[18] and worked as an accountant before becoming a housewife.[16][19] Stefani's parents were fans of folk music and exposed her to music by artists like Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris.[14] Stefani has two younger siblings, Jill and Todd, and an older brother, Eric.[14][19] Eric was the keyboardist for No Doubt before leaving the band to pursue a career in animation on The Simpsons.[13]Her brother Eric introduced Gwen to 2 Tone music by Madness and the Selecter and, in 1986, he invited her to provide vocals for No Doubt, a ska band he was forming.[13] In 1991 the band was  signed to Interscope Records.[20] The band released its self-titled debut album in 1992, but its ska-pop sound was unsuccessful due to the popularity of grunge.[21] Before the mainstream success of both No Doubt and Sublime, Stefani contributed guest vocals to \"Saw Red\" on Sublime's 1994 album Robbin' the Hood. Stefani rejected the aggressiveness of female grunge artists and cited Blondie singer Debbie Harry's combination of power and sex appeal as a major influence.[22] No Doubt's third album, Tragic Kingdom (1995), which followed the self-released The Beacon Street Collection (1995), took more than three years to make. Five singles were released from Tragic Kingdom, including \"Don't Speak\", which led the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997.[23] Stefani left college for one semester to tour for Tragic Kingdom but did not return when touring lasted two and a half years.[14] The album was nominated for a Grammy and sold more than 16\u00a0million copies worldwide by 2004.[14][24][25] In late 2000, Rolling Stone magazine named her \"the Queen of Confessional Pop\".[26]During the time when No Doubt was receiving mainstream success, Stefani collaborated on the singles \"You're the Boss\" with the Brian Setzer Orchestra, \"South Side\" with Moby, and \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" with Eve. No Doubt released the less popular Return of Saturn in 2000, which expanded upon the new wave influences of Tragic Kingdom.[27] Most of the lyrical content focused on Stefani's often rocky relationship with then-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and her insecurities, including indecision on settling down and having a child.[28] The band's 2001 album, Rock Steady, explored more reggae and dancehall sounds, while maintaining the band's new wave influences.[29] The album generated career-highest singles chart positions in the United States,[30] and \"Hey Baby\" and \"Underneath It All\" received Grammy Awards. A greatest hits collection, The Singles 1992\u20132003, which includes a cover of Talk Talk's \"It's My Life\", was released in 2003. In 2002, Eve and Stefani won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\".[31]Stefani's debut solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was released on November 12, 2004. The album features several collaborations with producers and other artists, including Tony Kanal, Tom Rothrock, Linda Perry, Andr\u00e9 3000, Nellee Hooper, the Neptunes and New Order. Stefani created the album to modernize the music to which she listened when in high school, and L.A.M.B. takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as new wave, synthpop, and electro.[32] Stefani's decision to use her solo career as an opportunity to delve further into pop music instead of trying \"to convince the world of [her] talent, depth and artistic worth\" was considered unusual.[5] The album was described as \"fun as hell but\u00a0... not exactly rife with subversive social commentary\".[33] The album debuted on the US Billboard 200 albums chart at number seven, selling 309,000 copies in its first week.[34] L.A.M.B. reached multi-platinum status in the United States,[16] the United Kingdom,[35] Australia,[36] and Canada.[37]The first single from the album was \"What You Waiting For?\", which debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart, charted at number 47 on the US Billboard Hot 100[38] and reached the top ten on most other charts.[39] The song served to explain why Stefani produced a solo album and discusses her fears in leaving No Doubt for a solo career[40] as well as her desire to have a baby.[41] \"Rich Girl\" was released as the album's second single. A duet with rapper Eve, and produced by Dr. Dre, it is an adaptation of a 1990s pop song by British musicians Louchie Lou & Michie One, which itself is a very loose cover lyrically but closer melodically of \"If I Were a Rich Man\", from the musical Fiddler on the Roof. \"Rich Girl\" reached the US and UK top ten.[38][42] The album's third single \"Hollaback Girl\" became Stefani's first US and second Australian number-one single; it reached top ten elsewhere.[38][43] The song was the first US music download to sell more than one million copies, and its brass-driven composition remained popular throughout 2005.[7] The fourth single \"Cool\" was released shortly following the popularity of its predecessor, reaching the top 20 in US and UK.[38][42] The song's lyrics and its accompanying music video, filmed on Lake Como, depict Stefani's former relationship with Kanal.[44] \"Luxurious\" was released as the album's fifth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. \"Crash\" was released in January 2006 as the album's sixth single in lieu of Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'s sequel, which Stefani postponed because of her pregnancy.[45]In 2004, Stefani showed interest in making film appearances and began auditioning for films such as Mr. & Mrs. Smith.[46] She made her film debut playing Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator in 2004. Scorsese, whose daughter was a No Doubt fan, showed reciprocal interest in casting Stefani after seeing her picture from a Marilyn Monroe-inspired photo shoot for Teen Vogue in 2003.[47][48] To prepare for the role, Stefani read two biographies and watched 18 of Harlow's films.[14] Shooting her part took four to five days, and Stefani had few lines.[49] Stefani lent her voice to the title character of the 2004 video game Malice, but the company opted not to use No Doubt band members' voices.[50]Stefani's second studio album, The Sweet Escape, was released on December 1, 2006.[51] Stefani continued working with Kanal, Perry, and the Neptunes, along with Akon and Tim Rice-Oxley from English rock band Keane. The album focuses more heavily on electronic and dance music for clubs than its predecessor.[16] Its release coincided with the DVD release of Stefani's first tour, entitled Harajuku Lovers Live. Sia Michel wrote that it \"has a surprisingly moody, lightly autobiographical feel\u00a0... but Stefani isn't convincing as a dissatisfied diva\"[52] and Rob Sheffield called the album a \"hasty return\" that repeats Love. Angel. Music. Baby. with less energy.[53]\"Wind It Up\", the album's lead single, used yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music,[54] and peaked in the top 10 in the US and the UK.[55] The title track reached the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[56] Three more singles were released from the album; \"4 in the Morning\", \"Now That You Got It\" which featured Damian Marley and \"Early Winter\". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated that she had no plans to continue work as a solo artist.[57]With Stefani promoting The Sweet Escape, No Doubt began work on a new album without her[58] and planned to complete it after Stefani's Sweet Escape Tour was finished.[59] In March 2008, the band started making posts concerning the progression of the album on their official fan forum. Stefani made a post on March 28, 2008, stating that songwriting had commenced but was slow on her end because she was pregnant with her second child.[60] The Singles 1992\u20132003 became available on December 9, 2008, for the video game Rock Band 2.[61] Adrian Young played drums on Scott Weiland's album \"Happy\" in Galoshes. No Doubt headlined the Bamboozle 2009 festival in May 2009, along with Fall Out Boy. The band completed a national tour in mid-2009.[62]The new album Push and Shove was released on September 25, preceded by the first single, \"Settle Down\", on July 16. The music video for \"Settle Down\" was directed by Sophie Muller (who has previously directed numerous music videos for No Doubt). Also around this time No Doubt were guest mentors for the UK version of The X-Factor.[63] \"Settle Down\" peaked at 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the album peaking at number three on the US Billboard 200. On November 3, 2012, the band pulled its music video \"Looking Hot\" from the Internet after receiving complaints that it was insensitive towards Native Americans.[64] In January 2013, No Doubt make a cameo appearance in a hot air ballon for the third season of Portlandia.[65]On April 12, 2014, Stefani made a surprise appearance at the Coachella festival, where she joined Pharrell Williams onstage during his set to perform \"Hollaback Girl\".[66] On April 29, it was officially confirmed that Stefani would join the seventh season of The Voice as a coach, replacing Christina Aguilera.[67] Nine years after the previous time, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards.[68] Stefani appears as a featured artist on Maroon 5's song \"My Heart Is Open\", co-written by Sia, from the band's album V,[69] which was performed for the first time with Adam Levine and an orchestra at the 2015 Grammy Awards.[70] Stefani also collaborated with Calvin Harris on the track \"Together\" from his album Motion.[71]On September 8, 2014, Stefani told MTV News during New York Fashion Week that she was working on both a No Doubt album and a solo album, and that she was working with Williams.[72] Stefani released her comeback single \"Baby Don't Lie\" on October 20, 2014, co-written with producers Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella.[73] Billboard announced that her third studio album was set to be released in December with Benny Blanco serving as executive producer.[74] In late October, \"Spark the Fire\", a new track from Stefani's third album, was released.

Stefani said much of the previous material she worked on in 2014 felt forced and inauthentic, the opposite of what she had originally wanted.[82][83][84] The album's second single, \"Make Me Like You\", was released on February 12, 2016.[85] This Is What the Truth Feels Like was released on March 18, 2016, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 84,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week, earning Stefani her first number-one album on the U.S. chart as a solo artist.[86] To further promote the album, Stefani embarked on her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in the United States.[87] Stefani voiced DJ Suki in the animated film Trolls, which was released on November 4, 2016.[88] She is also included on five songs from the film's official soundtrack.[89] Stefani twice performed as part of the \"Final Shows\" at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on October 29\u201330, before the venue's closure due to The Irvine Company not renewing the venue's land lease.[90][91]Stefani was interviewed for the documentary series The Defiant Ones, which was released in July 2017.[92] The same month, she announced plans to release new music by the end of the year.[93] In August, several song titles from the singer's sessions were published on GEMA's official website, suggesting that she may be recording a holiday album.[94] The songwriting credits from the leaked tracks had Stefani collaborating with busbee, Blake Shelton, and Justin Tranter.[95] The album, titled You Make It Feel Like Christmas, was released on October 6, 2017.[96] Its title track, featuring guest vocals from Shelton, was digitally distributed on September 22, 2017, as the lead single.[97] To promote the record, Stefani hosted Gwen Stefani's You Make It Feel Like Christmas, an NBC Christmas television special that aired on December 12, 2017.[98]Stefani's first concert residency, titled Just a Girl: Las Vegas, began on June 27, 2018, at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas.

Angel. Music. Baby., and was criticized for doing so.[174]This Is What the Truth Feels Like, the singer's third album, continued Stefani's endeavors with the pop genre, while incorporating music from a variety of other genres including reggae,[175] disco,[176] and dancehall,[177] as well as the use of guitars.[178] Stefani's lyrics shifted towards events that had recently occurred in her personal life, such as her divorce from Rossdale, and new relationship with Shelton.[179] The singer stated her album was more about forgiveness than revenge.[180]Stefani began wearing a bindi in the mid-1990s after attending several family gatherings with Tony Kanal, who is of Indian heritage.[181] During No Doubt's breakthrough, Stefani wore the forehead decoration in several of the band's music videos and briefly popularized the accessory in 1997.[182] Since the 1995 music video for \"Just a Girl\", Stefani has been known for her midriff and frequently wears tops that expose it.[183] Stefani's makeup design generally includes light face powder, bright red lipstick, and arched eyebrows; she wrote about the subject in a song titled \"Magic's in the Makeup\" for No Doubt's Return of Saturn, asking \"If the magic's in the makeup/Then who am I?\".[14] Stefani is a natural brunette, but her hair has not been its natural color since she was in ninth grade.[184] Since late 1994, she has usually had platinum blonde hair. Stefani discussed this in the song \"Platinum Blonde Life\" on Rock Steady and played original blonde bombshell Jean Harlow in the 2004 biopic The Aviator.[185] She dyed her hair blue in 1998[182] and pink in 1999,[186] when she appeared on the cover of Return of Saturn with pink hair.[187]In 2006, Stefani modified her image, inspired by that of Michelle Pfeiffer's character Elvira Hancock in the 1983 film Scarface.[6] The reinvented image included a symbol consisting of two back-to-back 'G's, which appears on a diamond-encrusted key she wears on a necklace and which became a motif in the promotion of The Sweet Escape.[129] Stefani raised concerns in January 2007 about her rapid weight loss following her pregnancy. She later stated that she had been on a diet since the sixth grade to fit in size 4 clothing.[188] A wax figure of Stefani was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas at The Venetian on September 22, 2010.[189] The release of Stefani's first solo album brought attention to her entourage of four Harajuku Girls, who appear in outfits influenced by Gothic Lolita fashion,[190] and are named for the area around the Harajuku Station of Tokyo. Stefani's clothing also took influence from Japanese fashion, in a style described as a combination between Christian Dior and Japan.[41] The dancers are featured in her music videos, press coverage, and on the album cover for Love. Angel. Music. Baby., with a song named for and dedicated to them on the album. They were also featured in, and the namesake for, Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour.

With No Doubt, she has won two Grammy Awards. In 2005, Rolling Stone called her \"the only true female rock star left on radio or MTV\" and featured her on the magazine's cover.[192] Stefani received the Style Icon Award at the first People Magazine Awards in 2014.[193] In 2016, the singer was honored at the Radio Disney Music Awards with a Hero Award, which is given to artists based on their personal contributions to various charitable works.[194]Stefani has been referred to as a \"Pop Princess\" by several contemporary music critics.[195][196][197] In 2012, VH1 listed the singer at the number thirteen on their list of \"100 Greatest Women in Music\".[11] Stefani's work has influenced artists and musicians including Hayley Williams of Paramore,[198] Best Coast,[199] Kim Petras,[200] Teddy Sinclair,[201] Katy Perry,[202] Charli XCX,[203] Kesha,[204] Ava Max,[205] Marina Diamandis,[206] Rita Ora,[207] Keke Palmer,[208] Bebe Rexha,[209] Dua Lipa,[210] the Stunners,[211] Kelly Clarkson,[212] Sky Ferreira,[213] Kirstin Maldonado of Pentatonix,[214] Olivia Rodrigo,[215] and Cover Drive.[216]  The latter group, a quartet of Barbados musicians, claimed that both Stefani and No Doubt had helped influence their music, to which the lead singer of the group, Amanda Reifer, said that she would \"pass out\" if she ever met Stefani.[216]The lead single from Love. Angel. Music. Baby., \"What You Waiting For?\", was considered by Pitchfork to be one of Stefani's best singles, and would later place it at number sixteen on their \"Top 50 Singles of 2004\" list.[217][218] \"Hollaback Girl\" from Love. Angel. Music. Baby. would go on to be the first song to digitally sell an excess of one million copies in the United States;[7] it was certified platinum in both the United States and Australia,[219][220] and peaked at number forty-one on Billboard's decade-end charts for 2000\u201309.[221] Since its release in 2005, \"Hollaback Girl\" has been called Stefani's \"signature song\" by Rolling Stone.[222]Following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, Stefani donated $1\u00a0million to Save the Children's Japan Earthquake\u2013Tsunami Children in Emergency Fund.[223] Stefani also ran an auction on eBay from April 11 to 25, 2011, allowing participants to bid on vintage clothing items from her personal wardrobe and custom T-shirts designed and signed by her, as well as an admission to a private Harajuku-themed tea party hosted by her on June 7, 2011, at Los Angeles' first-ever Japanese-style maid caf\u00e9 and pop art space, Royal/T, with proceeds from the auction going to Save the Children's relief effort.[224][225]At the amfAR gala during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Stefani auctioned off the lacy black dress she wore at the event for charity, raising over $125,000.[226] A representative for designer Michael Angel, who helped Stefani with the design and worked as a stylist, said that Angel created the gown, not Stefani.[226][227] In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala.[228] Stefani hosted a fundraiser with First Lady Michelle Obama in August 2012 at the singer's Beverly Hills home.[229]The singer-songwriter supports the LGBT community. When asked in a 2019 Pride Source interview about how she would react if one of her children came out as gay, Stefani stated \"I would be blessed with a gay son; [...] I just want my boys to be healthy and happy. And I just ask God to guide me to be a good mother, which is not an easy thing at all.\"[230]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Avril_Lavigne": "Avril Ramona Lavigne (/\u02cc\u00e6vr\u026al l\u0259\u02c8vi\u02d0n/ AV-ril l\u0259-VEEN; born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She has released seven studio albums and has received several accolades and nominations, including eight Grammy Award nominations.At age 16, Lavigne signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records. Her debut studio album, Let Go (2002), is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. It yielded the singles \"Complicated\" and \"Sk8er Boi\", which emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title \"Pop Punk Queen\" from music publications.[3][4] She is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music, since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s.[5][6] Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide.Lavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories.[7][8][9] Lavigne released her sixth studio album, Head Above Water in 2019. She returned to her punk roots with her seventh studio album, Love Sux (2022).[10]Alongside her music career, Lavigne voiced an animated character in the film Over the Hedge (2006), and made her screen acting debut in Fast Food Nation (2006).Lavigne was born on September 27, 1984, in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. She was named Avril (the French word for April) by her father.[11] He and Lavigne's mother recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" on the way home from church.[12] Lavigne has an older brother named Matthew and a younger sister named Michelle,[13] both of whom teased her when she sang. \"My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.\"[12] She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama.[14] Lavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec.[15][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of Morhange in France in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne, was born in 1954 at RCAF Station Grostenquin near Grostenquin, Lorraine, France.[16] When Jean-Claude was a child, the family moved to Ontario, Canada, and in 1975, he married Judith-Rosanne \"Judy\" Loshaw.[17][18]When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Napanee (now incorporated as Greater Napanee),[19] Ontario, a town with a population of approximately 5,000 at the time.[20][21][22]Her parents supported her singing; her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and he converted their basement into a studio. Following his own love for music, Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Centre in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.[23]Lavigne performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, The Chicks and Shania Twain. She began writing her own songs. Her first song was called \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\", about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\".[24] Lavigne also played hockey during high school and won MVP twice as a right winger in a boys league.[25]In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.[26][19][20] Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, \"What Made You Say That\",[19] and Lavigne told Twain that she aspired to be \"a famous singer\".[20] During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow-up album, My Window to You, in 2000.In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario.[19][20] Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.[27] Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.[28] Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song \"Why\". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.[27]In November 2000,[21] Ken Krongard, an A&R representative, invited Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition \"so impressed\" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25\u00a0million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.[22][19] By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.[21][29][24] Lavigne's band, which were mostly the members of Closet Monster, was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.[30]Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team\u2014including \"Complicated\", later released as her debut single\u2014that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, Let Go, finished in January 2002.[31]Lavigne released Let Go in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK\u2014this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time.[32] By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year.[33] By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[34] By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide.[35] By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.[36]Lavigne's debut single, \"Complicated\", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. \"Complicated\" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US,[37] where subsequent singles \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\" reached the top ten.[38] With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart.[39] Lavigne was named Best New Artist (for \"Complicated\") at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards,[40] won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations,[41] received a World Music Award for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Singer\", and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for \"Complicated\".[42]In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Hundred Million\" by the pop punk band Treble Charger.[43] In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine,[17] and in May she performed \"Fuel\" during MTV's Icon tribute to Metallica.[44][45] During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered Green Day's \"Basket Case\".[46]Lavigne's second studio album, Under My Skin, was released in May 2004 and debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US.[47] The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada[48] and has sold 10 million copies,[49] including 3.2\u00a0million in the US.[50] Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that Under My Skin proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that \"each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs\".[51] \"Don't Tell Me\", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. \"My Happy Ending\", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, \"Nobody's Home\", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.During early 2004 Lavigne went on the 'Live and By Surprise' acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote Under My Skin, accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld. In September 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long Bonez Tour. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for 'World's Best Pop/Rock Artist' and 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist', and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including 'Artist of the Year'.[52] She also won in the category of 'Favorite Female Singer' at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.[53]Lavigne co-wrote the song \"Breakaway\", which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.[54] \"Breakaway\" was released as a single in mid 2004 and subsequently included as the title track on Clarkson's second album, Breakaway.

It was thought that her concert on August 29 would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on August 31.[68] On August 21, 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.[69]In January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney to create clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton's feature film Alice in Wonderland. She recorded a song for its soundtrack, \"Alice\", which was played over the end credits and included on the soundtrack album Almost Alice.[70][71][72] In February, Lavigne performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.[73] Lavigne's song \"I'm with You\" was sampled by Rihanna on the track \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album, Loud (2010).[74][75] \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" was released as a single the following year, and Lavigne appeared in its music video.[76] In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released \"Dancing Crazy\", a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback.

Its opening track, \"Black Star\", was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name.[78][79] Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age.[79][80] The release date for Goodbye Lullaby was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label.[81][82] Goodbye Lullaby was released in March 2011,[83][80] and its lead single, \"What the Hell\", premiered in December 2010, ahead of the album's release.[83] Goodbye Lullaby received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.[52] By March 2018, Goodbye Lullaby sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.[36]Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of Goodbye Lullaby[84] and \"pop and more fun again\".[85][86][87] In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to Epic Records, headed by L.

Like boys, like dating or relationships\".[148] Musically, it is considered[by whom?] her heaviest album, showcasing ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nu metal,[149][150][151][152] which anticipated the emotional intensity and theatrical aesthetics of emo-pop music before it came into the mainstream.[153] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. \"Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through.\"[154] Her objective in writing the album was simply to \"make it fun\".[155] Lavigne was praised[by whom?] for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs.[156] Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,[78] with Lavigne describing the album as \"more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional\".[157] Ian McKellen defined her as \"a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.[158][159]I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say.\u2014 Lavigne on her musical artistry[146]While Lavigne said she was not angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said \"I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me\", adding that she had been writing \"full-structured songs\" since she was 14.[51] Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned[by whom?] throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, said that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\". Lavigne said that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that \"[N]one of those songs aren't from me\".[147]In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism[160] and criticized her songwriting, saying that \"Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything.\"[161] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for \"clear defamation\" against her character.[162] Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that \"Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.\"[160] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" for her song \"Girlfriend\".[163] Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, \"me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.\"[162] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.[164]Lavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain;[147][24] and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin.[148] By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, the Offspring, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, the Cranberries, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.[165][166][167][168][169][170][171][172]Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she said she was not. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, \"It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest\".[173] Lavigne commented on the matter: \"I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel\u00a0... punk, and I am so not any of them.\"[51] However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: \"I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.\"[165][174]I have to fight to keep my image really me\u00a0... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I have a great body.\u2014 Lavigne on her image early in her career[21]When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style,[175] in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.[176][177] She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses,[73] wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.[23] During photo shoots, instead of wearing \"glittery get-ups\", she preferred wearing \"old, crumpled T's\".[21] In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the \"pop punk princess\"[178][179] and the female answer to Blink-182.[180] Press and fans regarded her as the \"anti-Britney\", in part because of her less commercial and \"real\" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. \"I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not.\"[23] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was \"wearing a costume\".[22] Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.[181]Lavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus[179] and developing an image marked by angst.[182] During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,[183] including \"tight jeans and heels\",[73] and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar.[175] Lavigne defended her new style: \"I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all\u00a0... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on\".[183]Lavigne has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some conspiracy theorists.[184] In an interview with Australia's KIIS 106.5 in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, stating: \"Yeah, some people think that I'm not the real me, which is so weird! Like, why would they even think that?\"[185]Lavigne is considered a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative rock scene, since she helped pave the way for the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop artists such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Courage My Love and Hey Monday.[186][187][188][189][190][191][192] She has been compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love, earning a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and has been called one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music.[193][6][194][195] Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style.[196][197] \"Sk8er Boi\", \"He Wasn't\" and \"Girlfriend\" are frequently listed among the best pop-punk songs of all time by critics.[198][199][200][201][202]Lavigne has influenced a wide array of musical artists, including acts such as Tramp Stamps,[203] Billie Eilish,[204] Rob Halford (Judas Priest),[205] Courage My Love,[206] 5 Seconds of Summer,[207] Yungblud,[208] Maggie Lindemann,[209] Tonight Alive,[210][211] Willow Smith,[212] Amanda Palmer,[213] Misono,[214] Rina Sawayama,[215] Hey Monday,[216] Grey,[217] Ed Sheeran,[218] Kailee Morgue,[219] Charli XCX,[220][221] MercyMe,[222] Olivia Rodrigo,[223][224] and Kirstin Maldonado.[225] Amy Studt was hailed as \"the U.K.'s answer\" to Avril Lavigne.[226] Lavigne also has fueled a significant influence on indie rock singer-songwriters such as Pale Waves,[227][228][229] Graace,[230] Phoebe Bridgers,[231][232] Soccer Mommy,[233] Snail Mail and Liz Phair.[234]On the rise of mid-to-late 2010s emo hip hop and emo rap, Lavigne has been noted as an influence of various musicians from that scene, with Nylon magazine noting Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, Vic Mensa, Nipsey Hussle, John River, Noname and Rico Nasty. American rapper Fat Tony explained that Lavigne's traces of influences on hip hop and rap music comes because \"she [Avril] delivered a great visual catchy package [punk music, pop music and skater culture] that describes all of them\". Rico Nasty named one of her alter egos, Trap Lavigne, citing \"She is a perfect representation of being hard and soft [...] she hated the term punk, but she was so punk rock\".[235]A persistent internet meme about a Lavigne-written song called \"Dolphins\" has been showing up on various lyric sites since 2007, but she did not write or record this song. The lyrics appear on dozens of lyric sites and various bands have recorded cover versions of the song that was never recorded by Lavigne.[236][237] Lavigne was featured in the 2003 game The Sims: Superstar as a non-playable celebrity.[238] In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel, Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes. She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, \"I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.\" The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication Young Adult Library Services nominated the series for \"Great Graphic Novels for Teens\".[239]In 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song \"Complicated\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[240] Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist. She has also received three American Music Awards nominations, one Brit Award nomination, and one MTV Video Music Award. She has received a total of 169 awards. Lavigne had sold more than 30 million singles and 40\u00a0million copies of her albums worldwide,[241][242] including over 12.4\u00a0million album copies in the US according to Billboard.[243] In 2009, Billboard named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the \"Best of the 2000s\" chart.[244] She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the US.[245][240]Lavigne achieved a Guinness World Record as being the youngest female solo artist to top the UK album chart, on January 11, 2003, at the age of 18 years and 106 days. The album Let Go reached number one in its 18th chart week.[246] She held the record until 2004, as the UK charts reported that Joss Stone's Mind Body & Soul took it the following year.[247] She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single \"Girlfriend\".[248] Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008; and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies, being the only Female Western Artist since the 2000s to achieve it.[249] Lavigne is the only artist to have performed on three different multi-sport events, such as two closing ceremonies of Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006[250] and Vancouver 2010[251]) and in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[252]Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".[146] Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,[253] performing \"Sk8er Boi\"[254] with her band in a nightclub.[255] She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Going the Distance. The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards[256] after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".[257]She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico[258] to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock.[259] She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.[259] On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".[146] The Flock was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7\u00a0million in the foreign box office.[260]Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and [screenwriter Karey] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"[citation needed] Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".[146] The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38\u00a0million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336\u00a0million worldwide.[261]In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in Fast Food Nation, based on the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal.[262] The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.[263] Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.[264][265] The film opened on November 17, 2006, and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2\u00a0million worldwide.[266]Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"[146] In August 2006, Canadian Business magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.[267] In September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the Hub Network televised singing competition Majors & Minors as a guest mentor alongside other singers, including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis.[76]In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.[268][269] Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",[65] which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"[270] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".[76]The designs were also featured on the Internet game Stardoll, where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.[271] On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week,[272] returning in 2011.[76] In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.[273] \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"[73]Lavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.[274] When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\"[275] Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).[276] Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop.[277] It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.[278] Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\",[279] though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\".[280] The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting,[279] where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.[280] Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\".[281] It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.[282]In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate Alice in Wonderland-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.[72] Her designs were exhibited at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in California beginning in May through September, alongside Colleen Atwood's costumes from the 2010 film.[283]Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty International, Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Special Olympics, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, US Campaign for Burma, Make-A-Wish Foundation and War Child. She has also appeared in ALDO ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on November 28, 2007, at the Bell Centre in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.[284] In November 2010, Lavigne attended the Clinton Global Initiative.[285]Lavigne worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour.[286] She covered \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" for War Child's Peace Songs compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" as her contribution to the compilation album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. Released on June 12, 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur.[287]On December 5, 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity event in Latin America, \"Teleton\". She performed acoustic versions of her hits \"Complicated\" and \"Girlfriend\" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman.[288] In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[289]On September 14, 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, \"The Avril Lavigne Foundation\", which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities[285][290] and works with leading charitable organizations.[273] The foundation partners with the Easter Seals, Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS,[291] Lavigne has worked with the latter two. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, \"I just really wanted to do more\".[290] Lavigne said on the foundation's website, \"I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share\".[292] Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, Global Philanthropy Group, advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.[285]In September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for Special Olympics as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her \"Team Rockstar\" event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles.[293][294] The athletes were the stars of the music video for \"Fly\", which was shot in Canada.[295]In September 2020, Lavigne announced a special livestream concert to raise awareness and funds in the fight against Lyme disease called The #FightLyme concert. The concert took place on October 25, with proceeds from all tickets and merchandise going to the Global Lyme Alliance, a pseudoscientific chronic Lyme disease advocacy group,[296] and her charity Avril Lavigne Foundation.[297][298]After winning her fourth Juno Award in April 2003, in reference to the Iraq War Lavigne said, \"I don't believe war is a way to solve problems. I think it's wrong .... I don't have that much respect for [U.S. President George] Bush\". She also said that she was \"really proud\" of then Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chr\u00e9tien for keeping Canada out of the war.[299]Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that second and do it.Lavigne on her tattoos[73]As of 2010[update], only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.[73] Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody's identical tattoo.[300] In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter \"D\" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.[73][301] Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.[73] In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.[302]Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word \"fuck\" on their ribs.[303][304] Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an \"Abbey Dawn\" on her left forearm and an \"XXV\" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the \"fuck\" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her \"favorite word\"[73]) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.[305] She added that she eventually wanted to get a \"big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name\u00a0... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life.\"[73] In July 2010, Lavigne had her then-boyfriend's name, \"Brody\", tattooed beneath her right breast.[306] In 2018, Lavigne got a traditional heart shaped tattoo with then boyfriend Phillip Sarofim.[307]Lavigne's father was born in France, and through jus sanguinis, she applied for a French passport, which she received in February 2011.[1][2] In January 2012, Lavigne sold her house in Bel-Air (on the market since May 2011),[308] and moved to Paris to study the French language. She rented an apartment and attended a Berlitz school.[309][310]Lavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17.[311] In June 2005, Whibley proposed to her.[312] The couple married on July 15, 2006, in Montecito, California. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, \"I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.\"[311] The divorce was finalized on November 16, 2010.[313] Lavigne started dating The Hills star Brody Jenner in February 2010.[314] After almost two years of dating, the couple split in January 2012.[314]Lavigne began dating fellow Canadian musician Chad Kroeger, frontman of the band Nickelback, in July 2012.[315][316][317][318] The relationship blossomed after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne's fifth album.[316][319][318] Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating.[319][315] The couple married at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on July 1, 2013 (which is Canada Day), after a year of being together.[318][320] On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced her separation from Kroeger via her official Instagram account,[321] and later divorced.[322]Lavigne began dating billionaire Phillip Sarofim in 2018. She broke up with him in 2019.[323] It was reported by People magazine that she began dating musician Pete Jonas in 2020.[324] She would later began dating Mod Sun around March 2021.[325] Lavigne announced their engagement via her social media accounts in April 2022.[326]In April 2015, Lavigne revealed to People magazine that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease after her 30th birthday in 2014.[327] In an interview with Billboard that same month, Lavigne said that she was in the recovery process and that she wanted to increase awareness of the disease.[98]Lavigne has been referred to as a vegan or a vegetarian.[328][329]Current membersFormer membersHeadliningPromotionalSupporting",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Standard-bearer": "A standard-bearer, also known as a flag-bearer is a person (soldier or civilian) who bears an emblem known as a standard or military Regulation Colours, i.e. either a type of flag or an inflexible but mobile image, which is used (and often honoured) as a formal, visual symbol of a state, prince, military unit, etc.[1] This can either be an occasional duty, often seen as an honour (especially on parade), or a permanent charge (also on the battlefield); the second type has even led in certain cases to this task being reflected in official rank titles such as Ensign, Cornet and F\u00e4hnrich.In the context of the Olympic Games, a flagbearer is the athlete who carries the flag of their country during the opening and closing ceremonies.While at present a purely ceremonial function, as far back as Roman warfare and medieval warfare the standard-bearer had an important role on the battlefield. In warfare: the standard-bearer acted as an indicator of where the position of a military unit was, with the bright, colorful standard or flag acting as a strong visual beacon to surrounding soldiers. Soldiers were typically ordered to follow and stay close to the standard or flag in order to maintain unit cohesion, and for a single commander to easily position his troops by only positioning his standard-bearer, typically with the aid of musical cues or loud verbal commands. It was an honorable position carrying a considerable risk, as a standard-bearer would be a major target for the opposing side's troops seeking to capture the standard or pull it down.In the Roman military the person carrying the standard was called Signifer. In addition to carrying the signum, the signifer also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. The Signifer was also a Duplicarius, paid twice the basic wage.In the militia of the cities of the Dutch Republic, the standard-bearer was often the youngest single man, who was shown in group portraits wearing rich clothing in addition to carrying the flag. Chosen ensigns were good candidates for painters to woo with their portrait skills.Frans Hals' visiting card in 1616 placed the young ensigns in key positionsWhen the trekschuit made day trips to Amsterdam possible in 1632, Hals also wooed wealthy ensigns of Amsterdam in 1633Rembrandt leaves Leiden and advertises his portrait skills in 1636 to wealthy ensigns in Haarlem and AmsterdamAndries Stilte chose Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck in 1640 for the \"Cloveniers\" flag of the Haarlem schutterij",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sentimental_ballad": "A sentimental ballad is an emotional style of music that often deals with romantic and intimate relationships, and to a lesser extent, loneliness, death, war, drug abuse, politics and religion, usually in a poignant but solemn manner.[1] Ballads are generally melodic enough to get the listener's attention.[2]Sentimental ballads are found in most music genres, such as pop, R&B, soul, country, folk, rock and electronic music.[3] Usually slow in tempo, ballads tend to have a lush musical arrangement which emphasizes the song's melody and harmonies. Characteristically, ballads use acoustic instruments such as guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. Many modern mainstream ballads tend to feature synthesizers, drum machines and even, to some extent, a dance rhythm.[4]Sentimental ballads had their origins in the early Tin Pan Alley music industry of the later 19th century.[5]  Initially known as \"tear-jerkers\" or \"drawing-room ballads\", they were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an opera, descendants perhaps of broadside ballads. As new genres of music began to emerge in the early 20th century, their popularity faded, but the association with sentimentality led to the term ballad being used for a slow love song from the 1950s onwards.[6]Sentimental ballads have their roots from medieval French chanson ballad\u00e9e or ballade, which were originally \"danced songs\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa.[7][8][9] As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from Scandinavian and Germanic traditions of storytelling.[10] Musically they were influenced by the Minnesinger.[11] The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in England is \"Judas\" in a 13th-century manuscript.[12]  A reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman indicates that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.[13]Ballads at this time were originally composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.[16] In the 18th century, ballad operas developed as a form of English stage entertainment, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.[17] In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music.[18]In the late 19th century, Danish folklorist Svend Grundtvig and Harvard professor Francis James Child attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions.[12]  Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.[19] There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.[10]By the Victorian era, ballad had come to mean any sentimental popular song, especially so-called \"royalty ballads\".[20] Some of Stephen Foster's songs exemplify this genre. By the 1920s, composers of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway used ballad to signify a slow, sentimental tune or love song, often written in a fairly standardized form. Jazz musicians sometimes broaden the term still further to embrace all slow-tempo pieces.[21] Notable sentimental ballads of this period include, \"Little Rosewood Casket\" (1870), \"After the Ball\" (1892), and \"Danny Boy\" (1913).[22]Popular sentimental ballad vocalists in this era include Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Andy Williams, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis and Perry Como. Their recordings were usually lush orchestral arrangements of current or recent rock and roll or pop hit songs. The most popular and enduring songs from this style of music are known as \"pop standards\" or (where relevant) \"American standards\". Many vocalists became involved in 1960s' vocal jazz and the rebirth of swing music, which was sometimes referred to as \"easy listening\" and was, in essence, a revival of popularity of the \"sweet bands\" that had been popular during the swing era, but with more emphasis on the vocalist and the sentimentality.[24]Soft rock, a subgenre that mainly consists of ballads, was derived from folk rock in the late 1960s, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major sentimental ballad artists of this decade included Barbra Streisand, Nana Mouskouri, Elton John, Engelbert Humperdinck, Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor. By the early 1970s, softer ballad songs by the Carpenters, Anne Murray, John Denver and Barry Manilow began to be played more often on \"Top 40\" radio.[25]Some rock-oriented acts such as Queen and the Eagles also produced ballads.[1][26][27]When the word ballad appears in the title of a song, as for example in the Beatles' \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" (1969) or Billy Joel's \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\" (1974), the folk music sense is generally implied. The term ballad is also sometimes applied to strophic story-songs more generally, such as Don McLean's \"American Pie\" (1971).[28][29][30]Prominent artists who made sentimental ballads in the 1980s include Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Peabo Bryson, Barry White, Luther Vandross and George Michael.[32]The 1990s mainstream pop/R&B singers such as Boyz II Men, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.[33]Newer female singer-songwriters such as Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Jewel, Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow also broke through on the AC chart during this time owing to their ballad-sound.[34]A popular trend in the early 2000s was remixing dance music hits into acoustic ballads (for example, the \"Candlelight Mix\" versions of \"Heaven\" by DJ Sammy, \"Listen To Your Heart\" by D.H.T., and \"Everytime We Touch\" by Cascada).[35]In the 2010s, indie musicians like Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men, the Lumineers and Ed Sheeran had indie songs that crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, due to their ballad-heavy sound.[36]Most pop standard and jazz ballads are built from a single, introductory verse, usually around 16 bars in length, and they end on the dominant \u2013 the chorus or refrain, usually 16 or 32 bars long and in AABA form (though other forms, such as ABAC, are not uncommon). In AABA forms, the B section is usually referred to as the bridge; often a brief coda, sometimes based on material from the bridge, is added, as in \"Over the Rainbow\".[37][38]The most common use of the term \"ballad\" in modern pop and R&B music is for an emotional song about romance, breakup and/or longing.[22] The singer would usually lament an unrequited or lost love, either where one party is oblivious to the existence of the other, where one party has moved on, or where a romantic affair has affected the relationship.[39][40]Simon Frith, the British sociomusicologist and former rock critic, identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of soul artists, particularly Ray Charles, and the adaptation of this style by performers such as Eric Burdon, Tom Jones, and Joe Cocker to produce slow-tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars, and sometimes choirs.[43] According to Charles Aaron, power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences while retaining their \"macho rocker\" mystique.[44] The hard rock power ballad typically expresses love or heartache through its lyrics, shifting into wordless intensity and emotional transcendence with heavy drumming and a distorted electric guitar solo representing the \"power\" in the power ballad.[45][46]Aaron argues that the hard rock power ballad broke into the mainstream of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier love songs such as Badfinger's \"Without You\", Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" and Aerosmith's \"Dream On\".[44] The Carpenters' \"Goodbye to Love\" has also been identified as a prototype of the power ballad, driven by the hard rock guitar sound of Tony Peluso.[47] British heavy metal band Judas Priest wrote many power ballads, starting with \"Dreamer Deceiver\" and \"Beyond the Realms of Death\".[46]American rock band Styx has been credited with releasing the first true power ballad, the song \"Lady\", in 1973.[48] Its writer, Dennis DeYoung is called the \"father of the power ballad\".[49] In the 1980s, bands such as Journey and REO Speedwagon contributed to the power ballad becoming a staple of hard rock performers who wanted to gain more radio airplay and satisfy their female audience members with a slower, more emotional love song. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was one of the bands showcasing this style, with songs such as \"Home Sweet Home\" and \"You're All I Need\".[50] Nearly every hard rock and glam metal band wrote at least one power ballad for each album, and record labels often released these as the album's second single.When grunge appeared as a counterpoint to the excesses of 1980s hard rock and glam metal, one of the distinctions of the grunge style was the absence of power ballads,[50] however, its subgenre post-grunge would have ballads thrown in the mix.Latin ballad refers to the ballad derived from bolero that originated in the early-1960s in Latin America and Spain.One of the most well-known Latin ballad singers of the 1970s and 1980s was Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9. Known as \"El Principe de La Cancion\" (The Prince of the Song), he sold over 40 million albums in his career and became a huge influence to later ballad singers such as Cristian Castro, Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez, Nelson Ned, Manuel Mijares and Lupita D'Alessio.[51]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Voice_type": "A voice type is a group of voices with similar vocal ranges, capable of singing in a  similar tessitura, and with similar vocal transition points (passaggi).[1] Voice classification is most strongly associated with European classical music, though it, and the terms it utilizes, are used in other styles of music as well.A singer will choose a repertoire that suits their instrument. Some singers such as Enrico Caruso, Rosa Ponselle, Joan Sutherland, Maria Callas, Jessye Norman, Ewa Podle\u015b, or Pl\u00e1cido Domingo have voices that allow them to sing roles from a wide variety of types; some singers such as Shirley Verrett or Grace Bumbry change type and even voice part over their careers; and some singers such as Leonie Rysanek have voices that lower with age, causing them to cycle through types over their careers. Some roles as well are hard to classify, having very unusual vocal requirements; Mozart wrote many of his roles for specific singers who often had remarkable voices, and some of Verdi's early works make extreme demands on its singers.[2]Many different voice types are used in vocal pedagogy in a variety of voice classification systems. Most of these types, however, are grouped into seven major voice categories that are, for the most part, acknowledged across the major voice classification systems. Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering the pre-pubescent voice, an eighth term, treble, is applied. Within each of these major categories, subcategories identify specific vocal qualities such as coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.[3] The vocal range of classical performance covers about five octaves, from a low G1 (in scientific pitch notation) to a high G6, although the extremes are rare. More commonly the range is from a low C2 to a high D6. Any individual's voice can perform over a range of one and a half to more than two octaves. Vocal ranges are grouped into overlapping types that each span about two octaves. Many singers fall between groups and can perform some parts in either type.Soprano range: The soprano is the highest singing voice. The typical soprano voice lies between C4 (middle C) and C6 (high C). The low extreme for sopranos is roughly A3 (just below middle C).[3] Most soprano roles do not extend above C6 although there are several standard soprano roles that call for D6. At the highest extreme, some coloratura soprano roles may reach to G6 (the G above high C).[4]Soprano tessitura: The tessitura of the soprano voice lies higher than all the other voices except the sopranino. In particular, the coloratura soprano has the highest tessitura of all the soprano subtypes.[5]Soprano subtypes: As with all voice types, sopranos are often divided into different subcategories based on range, vocal color or timbre, the weight of voice, and dexterity of the voice. Sopranos are often broken down into five subcategories: coloratura soprano, soubrette, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and dramatic soprano.[5]Two types of soprano especially dear to the French are the Dugazon and the Falcon, which are intermediate voice types between the soprano and the mezzo-soprano. A Dugazon is a darker-colored soubrette. A Falcon a darker-colored soprano drammatico.[6]Mezzo-soprano range: The mezzo-soprano voice is the middle-range voice type for females;[3] it lies between the soprano and contralto ranges, over-lapping both of them. The typical range of this voice is between A3 (the A below middle C) to A5 (two octaves higher). In the lower and upper extremes, some mezzo-sopranos may extend down to F3 (the F below middle C) and as high as C6 (high C).[3]Mezzo-soprano tessitura: Although this voice overlaps both the contralto and soprano voices, the tessitura of the mezzo-soprano is lower than that of the soprano and higher than that of the contralto.Mezzo-soprano subtypes: Mezzo-sopranos are often broken down into three subcategories: lyric mezzo-soprano, coloratura mezzo-soprano and dramatic mezzo-soprano.[5]Contralto range: The contralto voice is the lowest female voice. A true operatic contralto is rare,[7] so much so that often roles intended for contralto are performed by mezzo-sopranos. The typical contralto range lies between F3 (the F below middle C) to F5 (the second F above middle C). In the lower and upper extremes some contralto voices can sing from D3 (the D below middle C) to B\u266d5 (the second B-flat above), one whole step short of the soprano high C.[3]Contralto tessitura:\nThe contralto voice has the lowest tessitura of the female voices.Contralto subtypes: Contraltos are often broken down into three subcategories: coloratura contralto, lyric contralto, and dramatic contralto.[5] A soprano sfogato is a contralto who has an extended high range reaching the soprano high C.While the countertenor is almost universally recognized as a voice category, it is not a voice type in the strictest sense. Except for a few very rare voices (such as the American male soprano Michael Maniaci or singers with a disorder such as Kallmann syndrome), countertenors generally sing in the falsetto register, sometimes using their modal voice for the lowest notes. The countertenor voice is therefore a product of the application of a specific technical approach, not the result of the biological factors which have long been credited with determining the other voice types included on this list. These factors include vocal-fold length, thickness, and other elements of laryngeal proportions.[8] All countertenors, save those rare examples previously mentioned, also fall into the traditional male voice categories, such as tenor and bass.[9] [10] [11]Countertenor range: The countertenor is the highest male voice. Many countertenor singers perform roles originally written for a castrato in baroque operas. Historically, there is much evidence that the countertenor, in England at least, also designated a very high tenor voice, the equivalent of the French haute-contre. Until about 1830, all male voices used some falsetto-type voice production in their upper range. Countertenor voices span a broad range, covering E3 to E5.Countertenor subtypes:\nCountertenors are often broken down into three subcategories: sopranist or \"male soprano\", the haute-contre, and the castrato. The last actual castrato singer, Alessandro Moreschi, died in 1922.[5]Tenor range: The tenor is the highest male voice within the modal register. The typical tenor voice lies between C3 (one octave below middle C) to C5 (one octave above middle C). The low extreme for tenors is roughly A\u266d2 (the second A-flat below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to F5 (the second F above middle C).[3]Tenor tessitura: The tessitura of the tenor voice lies above the baritone voice and below the countertenor voice. The Tenorino has the highest tessitura of all the tenor subtypes.[5]Tenor subtypes: Tenors are often divided into different subcategories based on range, vocal color or timbre, the weight of the voice, and dexterity of the voice. Tenors are often broken down into eight subcategories: Tenorino, tenore contraltino, leggero tenor or tenore di grazia, lyric tenor, spinto tenor or tenore spinto, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and baritenor.[5] Famous tenors include Enrico Caruso, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Alfredo Kraus, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras.Baritone range: The baritone voice is the middle-range voice type for males; it lies between the bass and tenor ranges, overlapping both of them. The typical baritone range is from A2 (the second A below middle C) to A4 (the A above middle C). A baritone's range might extend down to F2 (the second F below middle C) or up to C5 (one octave above middle C). The baritone voice type is the most common male voice.[3]Baritone tessitura: Although this voice range overlaps both the tenor and bass ranges, the tessitura of the baritone is lower than that of the tenor and higher than that of the bass.[5]Baritone subtypes: Baritones are often divided into different subcategories based on range, vocal color or timbre, the weight of the voice, and dexterity of the voice. Baritones are often broken down into nine subcategories: baryton-Martin, lyric baritone, bel canto or coloratura baritone, kavalierbariton, heldenbaritone, Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, baryton-noble, and bass-baritone.[5]Bass range: The bass is the lowest singing voice. The bass voice has the lowest tessitura of all the voices. The typical bass range lies between E2 (the second E below middle C) to E4 (the E above middle C). In the lower and upper extremes of the bass voice, some basses can sing from C2 (two octaves below middle C) to G4 (the G above middle C).[5]Bass subtypes: Basses are often divided into different subcategories based on range, vocal color or timbre, the weight of the voice, and dexterity of the voice. Basses are often broken down into six subcategories: basso profondo, basso buffo, bel canto bass, basso cantante, dramatic bass, and bass-baritone.[5]A human voice will alter as a person gets older. The vocal range and timbre of children's voices do not have the variety that adults' voices have. Both sexes before puberty have a similar vocal range and timbre because both groups have a similar larynx size and weight and a similar vocal cord structure and color. With the onset of puberty, women's, and particularly men's, voices alter as the vocal ligaments become more defined and the laryngeal cartilages harden. The height of the male larynx becomes much greater than in women. Size and development of adult lungs also changes physical capabilities of the voice. During puberty, the human voice is in an in-between phase where it is not quite a child's voice nor an adult one yet. This is not to suggest that the voice stops changing after puberty. Different singers will reach adult development earlier or later than others, and as stated above, there are continual changes throughout adulthood. A classic example for this continual change in men particularly is a loss of a more extreme bottom range gained at the beginning of puberty, only for this range to very often return in older age.[12]Treble can refer to either a young female or young male singer with an unchanged voice in the mezzo-soprano range. Initially, the term was associated with boy sopranos but as the inclusion of girls into children's choirs became acceptable in the 20th\u00a0century the term has expanded to refer to all pre-pubescent voices. The lumping of children's voices into one category is also practical, as boys and girls share a similar range and timbre.[12]Most trebles have an approximate range from A3 (the A below middle C) to C6 (top C) or above.[13][14] For high notes see, for example, the treble solo at the beginning of Stanford's Magnificat in G, David Willcocks' descant to Mendelssohn's tune for the carol \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\", and the even higher treble solo in the \"Nunc dimittis\" from Tippett's evening canticles written for St John's College, Cambridge. Many trebles are also able to reach higher notes by use of the whistle register but this practice is rarely called for in performance.[3]Vocal pedagogues generally consider four main qualities of a human voice when attempting to classify it: vocal range, tessitura, timbre, and vocal transition points known as passaggio. However, teachers may also consider physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and other factors such as vocal register. Voice classification into the correct voice type is important for vocal pedagogues and singers as a guiding tool for the development of the voice.Misclassification of a singer's voice type is dangerous. It can damage the vocal cords, shorten a singing career, and lead to the loss of both vocal beauty and free vocal production. Some of these dangers are not immediate ones; the human voice is quite resilient, especially in early adulthood, and the damage may not make its appearance for months or even years. Unfortunately, this lack of apparent immediate harm can cause singers to develop bad habits that will over time cause irreparable damage to the voice.[3] Singing outside the natural vocal range imposes a serious strain upon the voice. Clinical evidence indicates that singing at a pitch level that is either too high or too low creates vocal pathology.[15] According to vocal pedagogue Margaret Greene, \"The need for choosing the correct natural range of the voice is of great importance in singing since the outer ends of the singing range need very careful production and should not be overworked, even in trained voices.\"[16] Singing at either extreme of the range may be damaging, but the possibility of damage seems to be much more prevalent in too high a classification. A number of medical authorities have indicated that singing at too high a pitch level may contribute to certain vocal disorders. Medical evidence indicates that singing at too high of a pitch level may lead to the development of vocal cord nodules. Increasing tension on the vocal cords is one of the means of raising pitch. Singing above an individual's best tessitura keeps the vocal cords under a great deal of unnecessary tension for long periods of time, and the possibility of vocal abuse is greatly increased. Singing at too low a pitch level is not as likely to be damaging unless a singer tries to force the voice down.[2]Many vocal pedagogues warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vocal pedagogue William Vennard has stated:Most vocal pedagogues believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice.[citation needed] When techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop.[16] Many vocal pedagogues suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to mis-classify or damage the voice.[3]Unlike other classification systems, choral music divides voices solely on the basis of vocal range. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into soprano, alto, tenor and bass (SATB). As a result, the typical chorus affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur.[3] Since most people have medium voices, they are often assigned a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.[18]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Soprano": "A soprano ([so\u02c8pra\u02d0no]) is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C4) = 261\u00a0Hz to \"high A\" (A5) = 880\u00a0Hz in choral music, or to \"soprano C\" (C6, two octaves above middle C) = 1046\u00a0Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which often encompasses the melody.[1] The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano.[2]The word \"soprano\" comes from the Italian word sopra (above, over, on top of),[3] as the soprano is the highest pitch human voice, often given to the leading female roles in operas.[4] \"Soprano\" refers mainly to women, but it can also be applied to men; \"sopranist\" is the term for a male countertenor able to sing in the soprano vocal range,[5] while a castrato is the term for a castrated male singer, typical of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries,[3] and a treble is a boy soprano who has not reached puberty yet and still able to sing in that range.[3]The term \"soprano\" is also based on the Latin word superius which, like soprano, referred to the highest pitch vocal range of all human voice types.[3] The word superius was especially used in choral and other multi-part vocal music between the 13th and 16th centuries.[3]The soprano has the highest vocal range of all voice types, with the highest tessitura. A soprano and a mezzo-soprano have a similar range, but their tessituras will lie in different parts of that range.[6]The low extreme for sopranos is roughly A3 or B\u266d3 (just below middle C). Within opera, the lowest demanded note for sopranos is F3 (from Richard Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten[7]). Often low notes in higher voices will project less, lack timbre, and tend to \"count less\" in roles (although some Verdi, Strauss and Wagner roles call for stronger singing below the staff). However, rarely is a soprano simply unable to sing a low note in a song within a soprano role.[6] Low notes can be reached with a lowered position of the larynx.The high extreme, at a minimum, for non-coloratura sopranos is \"soprano C\" (C6 two octaves above middle C), and many roles in the standard repertoire call for C\u266f6 or D6. A couple of roles have optional E\u266d6s, as well. In the coloratura repertoire several roles call for E\u266d6 on up to F6. In rare cases, some coloratura roles go as high as G6 or G\u266f6, such as Mozart's concert aria \"Popoli di Tessaglia!\", or the title role of Jules Massenet's opera Esclarmonde. While not necessarily within the tessitura, a good soprano will be able to sing her top notes full-throated, with timbre and dynamic control.[8]In opera, the tessitura, vocal weight, and timbre of voices, and the roles they sing, are commonly categorized into voice types, often called F\u00e4cher (sg. Fach, from German Fach or Stimmfach, \"vocal category\").[8] A singer's tessitura is where the voice has the best timbre, easy volume, and most comfort.In SATB four-part mixed chorus, the soprano is the highest vocal range, above the alto, tenor, and bass. Sopranos commonly sing in the tessitura G4-A5. When the composer calls for divisi, sopranos can be separated into Soprano I (highest part) and Soprano II (lower soprano part).In contrast to choral singing, in classical solo singing a person is classified through the identification of several vocal traits, including range, vocal timbre, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal resonance, and vocal transition points (lifts or \"passaggio\") within the singer's voice.[citation needed]These different traits are used to identify different sub-types within the voice. Within opera, particular roles are written with specific kinds of soprano voices in mind, causing certain roles to be associated with certain kinds of voices.[9]Within the soprano voice type category are five generally recognized subcategories: coloratura soprano, soubrette, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and dramatic soprano.The coloratura soprano may be a lyric coloratura or a dramatic coloratura. The lyric coloratura soprano is a very agile light voice with a high upper extension capable of fast vocal coloratura. Light coloraturas have a range of approximately middle C (C4) to \"high F\" (in alt) (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat lower or higher,[5] e.g. an interpolated A\u266d6 in the Doll Aria, \"Les oiseaux dans la charmille\", from The Tales of Hoffmann, e.g. by Rachele Gilmore in a 2009 performance, and a written A\u266e6 by Audrey Luna in 2017 in The Exterminating Angel, both at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.[10]The dramatic coloratura soprano is a coloratura soprano with great flexibility in high-lying velocity passages, yet with great sustaining power comparable to that of a full spinto or dramatic soprano. Dramatic coloraturas have a range of approximately \"low B\" (B3) to \"high F\" (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat higher or lower.[8]In classical music and opera, a soubrette soprano refers to both a voice type and a particular type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet timbre, a tessitura in the mid-range, and with no extensive coloratura. The soubrette voice is not a weak voice, for it must carry over an orchestra without a microphone like all voices in opera. The voice, however, has a lighter vocal weight than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes, but, as they grow older and the voice matures more physically, they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a light lyric soprano, a lyric coloratura soprano, or a coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career.[1] A soubrette's range extends approximately from middle C (C4) to \"high D\" (D6).[11] The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and spinto soprano.[6]The lyric soprano is a warm voice with a bright, full timbre, which can be heard over a big orchestra. It generally has a higher tessitura than a soubrette and usually plays ing\u00e9nues and other sympathetic characters in opera. Lyric sopranos have a range from approximately middle C (C4) to \"high D\" (D6).[8]The lyric soprano may be a light lyric soprano or a full lyric soprano.[6] The light lyric soprano has a bigger voice than a soubrette but still possesses a youthful quality.[6] The full lyric soprano has a more mature sound than a light-lyric soprano and can be heard over a bigger orchestra.[6]Also lirico-spinto, Italian for \"pushed lyric\", the spinto soprano has the brightness and height of a lyric soprano, but can be \"pushed\" to dramatic climaxes without strain, and may have a somewhat darker timbre. Spinto sopranos have a range from approximately B (B3) to \"high D\" (D6).[8]A dramatic soprano (or soprano robusto) has a powerful, rich, emotive voice that can sing over a full orchestra. Usually (but not always) this voice has a lower tessitura than other sopranos, and a darker timbre. Dramatic sopranos have a range from approximately A (A3) to \"high C\" (C6).[8]Some dramatic sopranos, known as Wagnerian sopranos, have a very big voice that can assert itself over an exceptionally large orchestra (over eighty pieces). These voices are substantial and very powerful and ideally even throughout the registers.[6]Two other types of soprano are the Dugazon and the Falcon, which are intermediate voice types between the soprano and the mezzo-soprano: a Dugazon is a darker-colored soubrette, a Falcon a darker-colored soprano drammatico.[8]",

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Joe_Biden": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (/\u02c8ba\u026ad\u0259n/ BY-d\u0259n; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.Biden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, moving with his family to New Castle County, Delaware, in 1953 when he was ten. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years and was influential in foreign affairs during Obama's presidency. He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995, dealing with drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties issues; led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden was reelected to the Senate six times and was the fourth-most senior sitting senator at the time when he became Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election, defeating John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Obama and Biden were reelected in 2012, defeating Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan.During eight years as vice president, Biden leaned on his Senate experience and frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans, including on the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resolved a debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which addressed the impending \"fiscal cliff\". He also oversaw infrastructure spending in 2009 to counteract the Great Recession. On foreign policy, Biden was a close counselor to the president and took a leading role in designing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011. In 2017, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction.Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris defeated incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. He is the oldest president and the first to have a female vice president. Biden proposed, lobbied for and signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act to help the United States recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant recession. He proposed the American Jobs Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was also signed into law. He nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Biden proposed an expansion of the social safety net, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. In foreign policy, Biden restored the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia, as well as authorizing billions in foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (n\u00e9e Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[5] Jean was of Irish descent,[6][7][8] while Joseph Sr. had English, French, and Irish ancestry.[9][8]Biden's father had been wealthy, but suffered financial setbacks around the time Biden was born,[10][11][12] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents.[13] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[14] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[15] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[16][17][11][13] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[13][14][18]At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[19] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[13][20] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[21][22] He graduated in 1961.[21] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football[23][24] and, as an unexceptional student,[25] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science and a minor in English.[26][27]Biden has a stutter, which has improved since his early twenties.[28] He says he reduced it by reciting poetry before a mirror,[22][29] but some observers suggested it affected his performance in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates.[30][31][32]On August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter (1942\u20131972), a student at Syracuse University,[26] after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[33] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III (1969\u20132015), Robert Hunter Biden (born 1970), and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden (1971\u20131972).[26]In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged \"mistake\" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.[25] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1]Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Nixon's conduct of the war.[34] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the Vietnam War. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[35]In 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[36][37] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[36] Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[36]In 1969, Biden practiced law first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat[38][36] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[39] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[36] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[38] Corporate law, however, did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[13] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[40]In 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[41][38][42] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[43][44][45] Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[46][47] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[48][49][50][51] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[52]In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs.[38] With minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.[13] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[53] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[40] He received help from the AFL\u2013CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[38] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[38][53] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[38] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[18] and he won with 50.5 percent of the vote.[53] At the time of his election, he was still 29 years old, but reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in as Senator.[54]On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[26][55] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged\u00a03) and Hunter (aged\u00a02) survived the accident and were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[56] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[18] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[57]Years later, Biden said he had heard that the truck driver allegedly drank alcohol before the collision. The driver's family denied that claim, and the police never substantiated it. Biden later apologized to the family.[58][59][60][61][62] The accident had filled him with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him,[63] and he had trouble focusing on work.[64][65]Biden credits his second wife, teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs, with the renewal of his interest in politics and life;[66] they met in 1975 on a blind date[67] and were married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977.[68][69] They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic, behind the Iron Curtain.[70][71] They are Roman Catholics and attend Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[72] Their daughter Ashley Biden (born 1981)[26] is a social worker. She is married to physician Howard Krein.[73] Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General[74] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[75][76] Hunter Biden is a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser.[77]From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[78][79] The seminar often had a waiting list. Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[80][81][82][83]In January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[84][56] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[84][56] At 30, he was the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.[85][86]To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[87]\u201474 minutes each way\u2014and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[18]During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[88] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[89]In his first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control.[90][91] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT\u00a0II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[92] When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT\u00a0I treaty loosely to allow development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty.[90] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[36]Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[93] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the Biden Crime Law, which included a ban on assault weapons,[94][95] and the Violence Against Women Act,[96] which he has called his most significant legislation.[97] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[98][99] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[100]In 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.[101][102][103] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[104] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell\u00a0v. Hodges.[105]Elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[106] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[107] As of 2020[update], he was the 18th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[108]In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[109] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[110]In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment.[111] In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;[112] he said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense\" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[93] At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.[111] Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[113]In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[114][115] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[115] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[115][116] Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[117]Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[18] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval\u200d\u2014\u200cgiven in an interview the previous year\u200d\u2014\u200cof a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[118] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[118][119] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[18] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[119] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9\u20135 vote[119] and then in the full Senate, 58\u201342.[120]During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[121] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[122] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[123][124] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[18] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment,[125] saying he wanted to preserve Thomas's privacy and the hearings' decency.[121][125] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52\u201348 vote, with Biden opposed.[18] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[125] Biden later sought out women to serve on the Judiciary Committee and emphasized women's issues in the committee's legislative agenda.[18] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[126]Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[127] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[128] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[18] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[18] with Biden one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[129] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[106][130]Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[131] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[90][132] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[131][132] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[133]Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[132] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[134]Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[90] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.[90][131] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[90][132] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.[135] Biden said he had told Milo\u0161evi\u0107, \"I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one.\"[135]Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnian Muslims, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance the Clinton administration preferred, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman.[135] The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.[90] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[132]As chair, Biden contributed to successfully encouraging the Clinton administration to commit the resources and political capital to broker what became the 1998 Good Friday Agreement between the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom through the Northern Ireland peace process.[136]On September 3, 1998, the resigning former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter had, according to Barton Gellman, accused the Clinton administration of obstructing weapons inspections in Iraq. Biden joined many other Senate Democrats and \"amplified on the Clinton administration's counterattack against former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter.\" He questioned whether Ritter was trying to \"appropriate the power 'to decide when to pull the trigger' of military force against Iraq\", and said that the Secretary of State would also have to consider the opinion of allies, the UNSC, and public opinion, before any intervention in Iraq.[137][138] In a Washington Post op-ed later that month, Biden criticized a unilateral \"confrontation-based policy\" but praised the idea of asking whether intervention might be necessary at some point, though he said it was \"above the pay grade\" of one weapons inspector.[139]In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[90] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milo\u0161evi\u0107 over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[132][140]Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[141] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[142] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[132] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaida, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[143] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[132][135] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[131][140]By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[132][135] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[144] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[145] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq.[146] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[147] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[146] but the idea was unfamiliar, had no political constituency, and failed to gain traction.[144] Iraq's political leadership denounced the resolution as de facto partitioning of the country, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement distancing itself from it.[146] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush's speech to Israel's Knesset in which Bush compared some Democrats to Western leaders who appeased Hitler before World War\u00a0II; Biden called the speech \"bullshit\", \"malarkey\", and \"outrageous\". He later apologized for his language.[148]Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[149] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[36][150][151] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[150][151]By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[152] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[153] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[154][155] but did not on two occasions in late August.[156]:\u200a230\u2013232\u200a[155] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[157]Earlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[158] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[18][25]A few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations was publicized.[25] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[159] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[160]Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[161][162] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[163] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[164] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[165]After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[106][166][167] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's.[168] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[169]Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[170] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[171] He withdrew from the race that evening.[172]Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[173]:\u200a336\u200a In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[144][174] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[173]:\u200a28,\u200a337\u2013338\u200a Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[174][173]:\u200a28,\u200a337\u2013338Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[175] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[175] and developed a strong personal rapport.[174] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[176] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[177] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[178][179] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[180]Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[181][182] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[183][184] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked.[173]:\u200a411\u2013414,\u200a419\u200a Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[185] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[173]:\u200a411\u2013414\u200a Publicly, Obama strategist David Axelrod said Biden's high popularity ratings had outweighed any unexpected comments.[186]As the financial crisis of 2007\u20132010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700\u00a0billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74\u201325.[187] On October 2, 2008, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.[188] Nationally, Biden had a 60% favorability rating in a Pew Research Center poll, compared to Palin's 44%.[183]On November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain\u2013Palin's 173.[189][190][191]At the same time Biden was running for vice president he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[192] as permitted by Delaware law.[106] On November\u00a04, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[193] Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.[194] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350\u00a0billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[195] and resigned from the Senate later that day.[n 2]Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[199] He chaired Obama's transition team[200] and headed an initiative to improve middle-class economic well-being.[201] In early January 2009, in his last act as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he visited the leaders of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan,[202] and on January 20 he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States[203]\u200d\u2014\u200cthe first vice president from Delaware[204] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[205][206]Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[207] In May, Biden visited Kosovo and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[208] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[209][210] but his skepticism was valued,[211] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[212] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[144] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[211] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[213] Biden said Iraq \"could be one of the great achievements of this administration\".[214] His January 2010 visit to Iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming Iraqi parliamentary election resulted in 59 of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the Iraqi government two days later.[215] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[216][217]Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[218] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[211] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[219]In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against traveling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[220] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[221][212][222] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[223] On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" during live national news telecasts. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[185]Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[224] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[207] White House press secretary Jay Carney, Biden's former communications director, said Biden played the role of \"the bad guy in the Situation Room\".[224] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden \"is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible.\"[211] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[211] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[225]Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[226] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[227][228] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[227][228] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[228][229] Biden then took the lead in trying to sell the agreement to a reluctant Democratic caucus in Congress.[228][230] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.In March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[231] By May 2011, a \"Biden panel\" with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan.[232][233] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[234][235][236] Biden had spent the most time of anyone in the administration bargaining with Congress on the debt question,[235] and one Republican staffer said, \"Biden's the only guy with real negotiating authority, and [McConnell] knows that his word is good. He was a key to the deal.\"[234]Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[216][237] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[238][239] He took the lead in notifying Congressional leaders of the successful outcome.[240]In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[226] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[241] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[241] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[242]Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[243] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[185][244][245] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[244] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[246] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[247][248] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[244]The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[249][216] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" drew attention to Biden.[249][250][251] The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"During any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion.\"[250]Biden was nominated for a second term as vice president at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in September.[252] Debating his Republican counterpart, Representative Paul Ryan, in the vice-presidential debate on October 11 he made a defense of the Obama administration's record.[253][254] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[255] over Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[256]In December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of gun violence in the United States in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[257] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[258][259] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[259]Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[260]Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[261][262][263]Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[264][265] Biden discussed federal guidelines on sexual assault on university campuses while giving a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He said, \"No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind. No means no.\"[266][267][268]Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[269] As Iraq fell apart during 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[270][271] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[272] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[273]In 2015, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invited Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress without notifying the Obama administration. This defiance of protocol led Biden and more than 50 congressional Democrats to skip Netanyahu's speech.[274] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with Serbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[275] In Kosovo, he attended a ceremony renaming a highway after his son Beau, in honor of Beau's service to Kosovo in training its judges and prosecutors.[276][277][278]Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[279]During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[280] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[280][281][282]As of September\u00a011, 2015[update], Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right\u00a0... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[283] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[284][285][286] In January 2016, Biden affirmed that it was the right decision, but admitted to regretting not running for president \"every day\".[287]After Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton on June 9, 2016, Biden endorsed her later that day.[288] Throughout the 2016 election, Biden strongly criticized Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump, in often colorful terms.[289][290]After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Titled the \"Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor\", Biden led panel discussions on history and politics and developed the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.[291] He also continued to lead efforts to find treatments for cancer.[292] In 2017 he wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[293] Biden earned $15.6\u00a0million in 2017\u20132018.[294] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[295]Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[296][297][298] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[299][300] In 2019, Biden criticized Brunei for its intention to implement Islamic laws that would allow death by stoning for adultery and homosexuality, calling it \"appalling and immoral\" and saying, \"There is no excuse\u2014not culture, not tradition\u2014for this kind of hate and inhumanity.\"[301] By 2019, Biden and his wife reported that their assets had increased to between $2.2 million and $8 million from speaking engagements and a contract to write a set of books.[302]Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[303] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[304] At one point he suggested he did not see a scenario where he would run again,[305][306] but a few days later, he said, \"I'll run if I can walk.\"[307] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[308] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[309] saying he was prompted to run, among other reasons, by his \"sense of duty.\"[310]In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[311] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[312][313][314] The media widely interpreted this pressure to investigate the Bidens as trying to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency, resulting in a political scandal[315][316] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives.Beginning in 2019, Trump and his allies falsely accused Biden of getting the Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin fired because he was supposedly pursuing an investigation into Burisma Holdings, which employed Hunter Biden. Biden was accused of withholding $1\u00a0billion in aid from Ukraine in this effort. In 2015, Biden pressured the Ukrainian parliament to remove Shokin because the United States, the European Union and other international organizations considered Shokin corrupt and ineffective, and in particular because Shokin was not assertively investigating Burisma. The withholding of the $1\u00a0billion in aid was part of this official policy.[317][318][319][320] The Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee, led by Republicans, investigated allegations of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine, ultimately releasing a report in September 2020 that detailed no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden, and concluded that it was \"not clear\" whether Hunter Biden's role in Burisma \"affected U.S. policy toward Ukraine\".[321][322]In March 2019 and April 2019, Biden was accused by eight women of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[323] Biden had previously described himself as a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior has caused trouble for him.[324] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[325]Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[326][327] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[328][329] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still was behind Bernie Sanders by 21.6 percentage points.[330] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[331] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March\u00a03 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, including Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, putting him in the lead overall.[332] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states (Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri) on March 10.[333]In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[334] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[334][335] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[336][337]When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[338] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[339] Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[340] In March 2020, Biden committed to choosing a woman as his running mate.[341] In June, Biden met the 1,991-delegate threshold needed to secure the party's presidential nomination.[342] On August 11, he announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[343]On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[344][345][346]Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H.\u00a0W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[347] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[348] On November\u00a023, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[349]On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[350] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times.\" He specifically called on Trump to \"go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege\", adding, \"it must end now.\"[351][352] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Pence declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[353]Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[354] At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office.[354] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[355] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[356] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[357] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[358]Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of a threat of widespread civil unrest. Biden took the oath of office on the Capitol's west steps and gave an inaugural address, but there were no spectators on the Mall and no in-person parades or inaugural balls. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[359]In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders, more than most recent presidents did in their first 100 days. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[360][361][362][363] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[364][365][366] In his first two weeks in office, Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[367]On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. In his first visit to the State Department as president, Biden said \"this war has to end\" and that the conflict had created a \"humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.\"[368] On February 25, the Biden administration \"struck a site in Syria used by two Iranian-backed militia groups in response to rocket attacks on American forces.\" This marked the first known action by the military under Biden.[369]On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus relief package he proposed and lobbied for that aimed to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession.[370] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, support for small businesses and state and local governments, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[371][372][373]Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" He said that the U.S. was arranging a plan for migrants to \"apply for asylum in place\", without leaving their original locations. In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[374] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help manage these children.[375]On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signalling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[376] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[377] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[378] On April 22\u201323, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%\u201352% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges. If the pledges made at the summit are met, they will cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 2.6\u20133.7 GtCO2e by 2030.[379][380] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress, in which he highlighted the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and addressed withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, the murder of George Floyd, and the U.S. Capitol attack while urging Congress to pass comprehensive immigration, gun, and health care reform.[381]In May 2021, during a flareup in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Biden expressed his support for Israel, saying \"my party still supports Israel\" amid disagreement from some Democrats.[382] In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[383]On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[384] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a holiday in 1986.[385] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated, touting the vaccines' effectiveness against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.[386] He also criticized the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, saying it was \"killing people\".[387] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use.[388]By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's appointed judges to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in their first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[389][390] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with the majority of appointments being women and people of color.[391] Most of his appointments have been in blue states, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already traditionally lean liberal.[392]In the first eight months of his presidency, Biden's approval rating, according to Morning Consult polling, remained above 50%. In August, it began to decline and lowered into the low forties by December.[393] The decline in his approval is attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[394][395][396][397]American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[398] By April 2021, the State Department was urging American civilians in Afghanistan to leave as soon as possible.[399][400] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1. As late as July, American intelligence assessments estimated Kabul would fall to the Taliban months or weeks after the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.[401][402] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[377] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[377]On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[377][403] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[404] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[405] with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched,[406][407][408] and for his silence and absence during the days before the Afghan government collapsed.[403][409][410]On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[403][411] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,\"[411][412] and blamed his predecessor Donald Trump, the Afghan president, and Afghan security forces for the speedy collapse.[413][414]On August 22, Biden said that his administration knew that ISIS-K was a \"likely source\" of threat.[415] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. Biden declared to the attackers that the United States \"will hunt you down and make you pay\".[416] On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[417] On August 29, another American drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children; the Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the mistake on September 17 and apologized.[418]The U.S. military left Afghanistan on August 30, with Biden saying that the evacuation effort was an \"extraordinary success\", by extracting over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies.[419] He acknowledged that between \"100 to 200\" Americans who wanted to leave were left in Afghanistan, despite his August 18 pledge to stay in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[420] The Biden administration, joining governments of almost 100 countries, said that the Taliban had given \"assurances\" that anyone \"with travel authorization from [these] countries\" would continue to be allowed to leave Afghanistan.[421]Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.7%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[422] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[423][424] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. Income growth was particularly strong at the low end of the pay scale.[425][426][427][428]As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[429][430] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[431][432] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[433] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[434]The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[435][436] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[437] Manchin finally rejected the bill, dooming its passage.[438]Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[439] He tried to convince China[440] and Australia[441] to do more. He convened an online Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change to press other countries to strengthen their climate policy.[442][443] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[444] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40% of global emissions.[445]In early 2022, Biden made efforts to change his public image after entering the year with low approval ratings, but they continued to fall, dipping to approximately 40% in aggregated polls by February.[446][447] He began the year by endorsing a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which had both failed to invoke cloture.[448] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[449]In January, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[450] a promise he reiterated after the announcement of Breyer's retirement.[451] In February, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[452] The Senate confirmed her on April 7.[453]Also in February, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $1 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[454][455][456]Biden is considered a moderate Democrat[457] and a centrist.[458][459] Throughout his long career, his positions have been aligned with the center of the Democratic Party.[460] In 2022, a political journalist wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic party.\"[461] He has a lifetime liberal 72% score from the Americans for Democratic Action through 2004, while the American Conservative Union gave him a lifetime conservative rating of 13% through 2008.[462]Biden supported the fiscal stimulus in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[463][464] the Obama administration's proposed increase in infrastructure spending;[464] subsidies for mass transit, including Amtrak, bus, and subway;[465] and the reduced military spending in the Obama administration's fiscal year 2014 budget.[466][467] He has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[468][469] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)[470] and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[471] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[472][473] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[472] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[474]Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012[475][476] and also supports Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[477][478] He opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources.[479] As a senator, he forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed. As vice president, he served as a White House liaison to police.[480][481]Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States to take part in the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer\u2013Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[482] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[483] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, nature conservation, and green building.[484] On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, Biden said he wanted to pressure China and other countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions via carbon tariffs if necessary.[485][486]Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China and build \"a united front of U.S. allies and partners to confront China's abusive behaviors and human rights violations\".[487] He has called China the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[488] Biden has voiced concerns about China's \"coercive and unfair\" economic practices and human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping.[489] He also pledged to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[490]Biden has said he is against regime change, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[491] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[492][224] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[493] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[494] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.[495] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[297] He has called North Korea a \"paper tiger\".[496] As vice president, Biden supported Obama's Cuban thaw.[497] He has said that, as president, he would restore U.S. membership in key United Nations bodies, such as the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization,[498] and possibly the Human Rights Council.[499] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[500][501] In 2021, Biden recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[502]Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[503][504][505] which he attributed to his having been elected young.[506] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[93] As of November\u00a02009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[507] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9\u00a0million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[508][509][510][511]The political writer Howard Fineman has written, \"Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton\u2014auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.\"[40] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people\u2014that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.\"[40] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself.\"[144]In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[512][513] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[514]Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has described Biden as loquacious.[515] He often deviates from prepared remarks[516] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth.\"[517][181][518][519] The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything.\"[181] In 2018, Biden called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[520] Some of his gaffes have been characterized as racially insensitive.[521][522][523][524]BooksBook contributionsPamphletsArticles",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_the_United_States": "The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020,[5] and mass vaccinations began four days later. The Moderna vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on December 17, 2020,[6] and the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on February 27, 2021.[7] By April 19, 2021, all U.S. states had opened vaccine eligibility to residents aged 16 and over.[8] On May 10, 2021, the FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15.[9] On August 23, 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine for individuals aged 16 and over.[10]The U.S. government first initiated the campaign under the presidency of Donald Trump with Operation Warp Speed, a public\u2013private partnership to expedite the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. Joe Biden became the new President of the United States on January 20, 2021. Biden began his term with an immediate goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within his first hundred days in office, signing an executive order which included increasing supplies for vaccination.[11][12][13] This goal was met on March 19, 2021.[14] On March 25, 2021, he announced he would increase the goal to 200 million within his first 100 days in office.[15] This goal was eventually reached on April 21, 2021.[16]By July 4, 2021, 67% of the United States' adult population had received at least one dose, just short of a goal of 70%. This goal was eventually met on August 2, 2021. While vaccines have helped significantly reduce the number of new COVID-19 infections nationwide, states with below-average vaccination rates began to see increasing numbers of cases credited to the highly infectious Delta variant by July 2021, which led to an increased push by organizations and companies to begin imposing de facto mandates for their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19.On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced plans by the federal government to use executive orders and emergency temporary standards enforced by OSHA to mandate the vaccination of all federal branch employees, and require that all companies with more than 100 employees regularly test all employees who are not yet fully vaccinated for COVID-19.[17] On January 26, 2022, OSHA completely withdrew the vaccine mandate for companies with more than 100 employees due to a ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States that blocked the mandate.[18][19]As of March 2022, according to The Commonwealth Fund, COVID-19 vaccination in the United States has prevented an additional 2.3 million deaths, an additional 17 million hospitalizations, and an additional 66.2 million infections from COVID-19. Vaccination has also prevented an additional $899.4 billion in healthcare costs.[20]The US map below is for the percent of people of all ages who received all doses prescribed by the initial COVID-19 vaccination protocol. Two of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. require two shots to be fully vaccinated. The other vaccine requires only one shot. Booster doses are recommended too.[21][22]Total number of people who have received vaccinations in the United States as of April 18, 2022Vaccines administered per pharmaceutical company as of February 10, 2022Vaccines were distributed to states on a population basis, with the vaccine rollouts being administered by each individual U.S. state. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that hospital workers and nursing home personnel be the first individuals vaccinated.[24] The subsequent phases of the rollout are determined by each individual state agency.The CDC has issued cards that can be used to track vaccine progress and serve as a proof of vaccination when requested (such as during international travel).[25] States such as California and New York have offered a digital immunity passport accessible via a mobile app.[26][27]On February 1, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security said it \"fully support[s] equal access to the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine distribution sites for undocumented immigrants\" and that related federal agencies \"will not conduct enforcement operations at or near vaccine distribution sites or clinics\".[28]States may have intended that vaccines be prioritized for their residents ahead of tourists, but there was some difficulty communicating and enforcing this. Some American adults have no driver's license,[29] and the United States does not automatically provide each citizen with identity documentation in a centralized system. Furthermore, when people did not show up for their vaccine appointments, many clinics vaccinated anyone else who happened to show up so that the doses would not be wasted. As a result, some tourists as well as undocumented immigrants were vaccinated.[30]As of early February 2021, states including Florida, California, New York, and Texas were specifically trying to restrict \"vaccine tourism\": brief visits to the U.S. with the primary intention of obtaining a vaccine.[31] However, contrary to rumors that spread on social media, the United States did not have a policy of cancelling visas or imposing fines on tourists who sought vaccination. Diplomats pointed out that the B1/B2 tourist visa allows people to seek medical treatment while within the United States, even if they do not turn out to be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.[32]As of May 13, 2021, according to the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, the following U.S. states were not requiring foreigners to present proof of residency to receive the vaccine: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming.[33] Thousands of Latin Americans were booking travel to the United States and being vaccinated in the country. Vaccination centers in some U.S. states were accepting foreign passports as valid identification. Travel agencies were advertising \"vaccination tourism,\" and the U.S. embassy in Peru, for example, advised that travelers to the United States could seek vaccination.[34][35] The governor of Alaska announced that, as of June 1, any international visitor over age 12 could be vaccinated in Alaska and vaccines would be available at airports for convenience.[36]From early 2020, more than seventy companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research.[37][38] 28 different vaccines are being worked on and developed using the research provided by those companies.[39] The global competition had national security implications for various countries.[40]In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5\u00a0billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act.[41][38] Among the labs working on a vaccine is the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which has previously studied other infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, ebola, and MERS. By March 18, tests had begun with dozens of volunteers in Seattle, sponsored by the U.S. government, and similar safety trials were planned for other potential vaccines.[42] Bill Gates, whose foundation shifted its focus nearly entirely to the pandemic, anticipated in early 2020 that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021.[43]On August 5, 2020, the United States agreed to pay Johnson & Johnson more than $1\u00a0billion to create a hundred million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The deal gave the U.S. an option to order an additional two hundred million. The doses were supposed to be provided for free to Americans if they are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.[44]On August 31, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released their outline for how the COVID-19 vaccine would be administered and distributed across the entire country.BIO, a trade group of all COVID-19 vaccine makers except AstraZeneca, tried to persuade Secretary Azar to publish strict FDA guidelines that would help ensure the safety and public uptake of the vaccine. Politics impacted scientific practice, however, when chief of staff Mark Meadows blocked the FDA when it was realized that the timing of the provisions would make it impossible for a vaccine to be authorized before the November election.[45][46] Ultimately, the guidelines emerged[47] from the Office of Management and Budget and were published on the FDA website.[48]As of October 2020, 44 were in clinical trials on humans, and 91 pre-clinical vaccines were being tested on animals.[49] Most of these trials were underway.[50]On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),[51][52] and the FDA announced that its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) would review the request.[53][54] An EUA is a mechanism under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 that permits products not yet fully approved by the FDA to be used as part of a current state of emergency.[55]On December 11, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine.[56][57] An initial shipment of 2.9 million doses were scheduled to be distributed rapidly, and Pfizer promised to continue supplying the rest of the hundred million doses through March 2021.[58][59] Pfizer had adequate stocks available and began this distribution on December 17, 2020, but the federal government reduced the amount Pfizer was allowed to distribute.[60][61]On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization,[62][63] which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020.[64][65] The U.S. planned to rapidly distribute 5.9 million doses with more to come later.[66][67]Despite his involvement in spurring their development via Operation Warp Speed, Trump largely downplayed vaccines during his final months in office, and both Trump and First Lady Melania Trump received the vaccine in private before Joe Biden took office as the new president in January 2021.[68][69][70]On February 27, 2021, the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for use. However, this vaccine has faced backlash from some government officials, believing it to be not as effective as Pfizer or Moderna. On March 5, the mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, rejected a shipment of the Janssen vaccine, saying, \"Moderna and Pfizer are the best. And I am going to do everything I can to make sure the residents of the city of Detroit get the best.\"[71] After backlash, Duggan declared he would no longer decline the vaccine.[72]On March 11, 2021, President Biden announced that he would direct all states to make vaccines available to all adults no later than May\u00a01.[73] On April\u00a06 he said he would direct states to make all adults eligible for vaccination by April 19.[74] This deadline was met after several states opened up vaccination to everyone 16 and above the same day.[75]On March 26, 2021 Ocugen submitted its master file for Covaxin a conventional inactivated vaccine to the FDA. In June the FDA suggested that the company go the longer route to gain full FDA approval instead of emergency use authorization.[76]As of May 2021, most experts thought the United States would be unable to achieve herd immunity, at least in the near term, given insufficient demand for the vaccines.[77] On that note, many sources are saying the new variants last longer than 14 days, such as those found at home and abroad.[78]On July 6, Biden announced plans for more targeted outreach in order to reach under-vaccinated populations, such as shifting from larger mass clinics to having wider availability at community locations and events, and going \"neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door\u2014literally knocking on doors\u2014to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus\" [79][80][81]On July 16, the FDA approved a request by Pfizer to give its vaccine a priority review designation, meaning that final approval of the vaccine would be pursued on an expedited timetable. While priority review processes usually take up to six months, it was expected that the Pfizer vaccine may be approved within weeks.[82][83][84] On August 23, the FDA announced that it had formally approved the Pfizer vaccine for individuals 16 and over. It remains subject to EUA for individuals aged 12 to 15.[10][85]Efforts have been made by private businesses to help encourage vaccination, including ridesharing services offering free transport to vaccine clinic sites, and promotional incentives and discounts being offered to those who present proof of a recent vaccination. Free items included beer, pizza, crawfish, donuts, and french fries.[86][87][88]  Some sports teams established partnerships to offer vaccine clinics at their venues on game days, with free tickets to games offered to those who use the clinics.[89][90] Free cannabis was available in Washington State when getting a vaccine at a dispensary.[91]Massachusetts ran a free lottery for fully vaccinated people, and gave out $6.5 million to ten people in the form of cash and scholarships.[92] \nOhio ran a similar lottery, Maine gave away hunting licenses, and West Virginia gave away $100 savings bonds.[88]Listed in millions,On August 12, 2021, the FDA amended the EUA for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines in order to allow a third, booster dose for patients who are immunocompromised or have received organ transplants. Director of the CDC Rochelle Walensky stated in a press briefing that \"certain people who are immune compromised, such as people who have had an organ transplant and some cancer patients, may not have had an adequate immune response to just two doses of the [vaccine].\" In an interview with Today, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Anthony Fauci stated that \"inevitably, there will be a time when we'll have to give boosts [to the general public]. What we're doing literally on a weekly and monthly basis is following cohorts of patients to determine if, when and whom should get it. But right now at this moment, other than the immune compromised, we're not going to be giving boosters to people.\"[96] The World Health Organization (WHO) discourages the use of booster shots for COVID-19 in developed countries, as they would divert supplies away from the unvaccinated.[97]On August 18, 2021, Walensky and acting Commissioner of the FDA Janet Woodcock released a joint statement indicating that, pending FDA approval, booster doses for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could become generally available by the week of September 20, for those who had received their second dose at least eight months prior. They stated that that protection against severe outcomes or death \"could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout\", such as health care workers and seniors.[98]On September 17, 2021, the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted unanimously against recommending that booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine be distributed to the general public, citing the lack of evidence that a third dose is safe for younger populations.[99] On September 23, Walensky officially approved the distribution of Pfizer booster doses to certain populations six months after their second dose, including those who are 65 and over, those with underlying conditions, and those who work in high-risk settings.[100] On October 14, 2021, the committee recommended a half-dose booster for the Moderna vaccine among the same populations.[101]The next day, the committee also recommended that a second dose be generally distributed for the Janssen vaccine, at least two months after the first. An FDA analysis cited that a single dose of the vaccine had a consistently lower efficacy in comparison to the mRNA vaccines.[102][103]On December 10, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use to the Pfizer vaccine.  On December 14, 2020, the first vaccine doses were administered. Sandra Lindsay of Queens, New York City, was the first American to be administered an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna vaccine was granted emergency use authorization three days later, on December 17.[107][108]On December 21, President-elect Joe Biden publicly received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine during a media event  at Christiana Hospital in Delaware. The event was intended as a means by the incoming Biden administration to boost public confidence in the vaccines. Biden stated that Trump \"deserve[d] some credit getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed\", and told the press \"It's going to take time, and in the meantime\u2014I don't want to sound a sour note here\u2014but I hope people listen to all the experts.\"[109][110][111] Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine on December 29, also in public.On March 12, 2021, the United States surpassed 100 million doses administered.[112]Over the course of the month, seven states (Arkansas,[113] Mississippi,[114] Ohio,[115] Connecticut, Arizona, Texas,[116] and Georgia[117]) made the vaccine available to all adults, following a period of selective vaccination for elderly and other vulnerable populations. California and Washington announced that all adults would be eligible for a vaccine starting April 15.[118] Indiana announced that it would make vaccines available to university students and would specifically facilitate the transfer of vaccines to university-based vaccine clinics, including one such clinic at the University of Notre Dame.[119] On Day 58 (March 19) of the Biden administration, it achieved its goal of administering 100 million doses within its first 100 days.  On March 25, the administration set a new goal of administering 200 million doses in its first 100 days.On April 3, more than four million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were reported administered in the past 24 hours, setting a new record and bringing the seven-day average to more than three million a day.[120] As of April 11, more than 187 million vaccine doses have been administered.[121] On April 13, the CDC and FDA issued a statement recommending a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \"out of an abundance of caution\" after six women aged 18 through 48 developed a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; on April 23, the recommended pause was lifted.[122][123][124] By April 19, all U.S. states had made Americans aged 16 and older eligible for vaccination.[8]On April 22, the Biden administration announced that it had achieved its new goal of 200 million vaccine doses administered within its first 100 days.  As of April 28, the CDC reported an average of 2.7 million daily vaccinations over the past week.[125]On May 4, 2021, Biden announced a new target of having at least 70% of U.S. adults receive one vaccine dose by July 4.[126]On May 10, 2021, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for use on adolescents aged 12\u201315, making the United States the second country in the world, after Canada, to do so.[127] On May 12, Director of the CDC Rochelle Walensky approved the recommendation.[128]  On May 25, the Biden administration announced that 50% of adults had been fully vaccinated.By June 2021, the pace of vaccination had begun to decrease, amid increasing spread of the highly-infectious Delta variant across the country.[129] On June 3, the White House announced additional private-sector partnerships in order to expand targeted outreach and vaccine availability, including an initiative to promote and offer vaccines through Black-owned barber shops throughout June, and a partnership with brewery Anheuser-Busch\u2014who pledged in a promotional campaign to offer a \"free beer\" to all adults over 21 if the country met Biden's 70% goal.[129][130]The United States passed 600,000 Covid deaths on Tuesday, June 15, more than 200 times higher than the number of lives lost during the attacks of September 11, 2001. By late-June, one-quarter of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. were attributable to the Delta variant. Dr. Fauci warned that vaccination disparities could lead to \"two Americas\" where less vaccinated U.S. populations were at much higher risk of COVID-19.[131]The U.S. missed Biden's 70% goal by approximately three million residents, or 3%. Only 18 states reached the 70% goal among their local population.[132] Generally, the goal was met for adults 27 and over, but not for younger populations. By early-July 2021, the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had declined by around 90% since the peak in January. However, cases had also begun to increase in parts of the country with below-average vaccination rates, and hesitancy towards the vaccine had become a partisan issue: a poll by The Washington Post and ABC News found that 86% of self-identified Democrats surveyed had received at least one dose, as opposed to 45% of self-identified Republicans, the 18 states that did reach 70% of first doses by July 4 were all won by Biden during the 2020 election,[133][132] and a July 8 report by KFF found that the average vaccination rate in counties that voted for Biden was growing in comparison to those that voted for Trump.[134]Anti-vaccination rhetoric increased among conservatives, including Republican politicians and right-wing media outlets (such as Fox News and Newsmax) promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories (such as falsely claiming that the Biden administration would impose mandatory door-to-door vaccination\u2014an exaggeration of Biden's recently announced plans for targeted outreach),[79][135][136][137] Republican lawmakers attempting to inhibit vaccine outreach,[137] and state laws to prohibit \"discrimination\" against the unvaccinated (which effectively ban vaccine mandates).[138][139][140]On July 15, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that health-related misinformation was a public health threat.[141][142] The next day, President Biden accused social networking service Facebook of \"killing people\" by enabling the spread of vaccine misinformation.[143]  On July 19, after criticism from Facebook over the comments, Biden stated that they were based on a report suggesting that approximately 12 social media users were responsible for at least 60% of vaccine misinformation, and clarified that \"Facebook isn't killing people, these 12 people are out there giving misinformation. Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information\". He went on to explain that \"My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation, the outrageous misinformation about the vaccine\".[141]In late-July, amid increasing COVID-19 hospitalizations in a number of Republican-led states, some Republican politicians became more vocal in promoting vaccination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,[144] Senator of Texas John Cornyn, and former Surgeon General Jerome Adams.[68][69] Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis\u2014who has been critical of Fauci and COVID-19 restrictions\u2014stated in a press appearance that vaccines were \"saving lives\" and \"reducing mortality\" (citing the majority of hospitalizations being unvaccinated individuals), while criticizing mask mandates as displaying a lack of confidence in the efficacy of vaccines.[145] McConnell used campaign funds to purchase radio advertisements in his home state of Kentucky to promote vaccination; the ad features McConnell discussing his childhood battle with Polio, and stating that the development of multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in such a short time was \"nothing short of a modern medical miracle\", in comparison to the \"decades\" it took to develop a Polio vaccine.[144][146]A number of conservative commentators also abruptly made statements in support of vaccination, including Fox News hosts Steve Doocy and Sean Hannity during broadcasts of Fox & Friends and Hannity respectively, Newsmax CEO and Trump confidant Christopher Ruddy (who praised Biden in an op-ed for \"making a huge dent\" in the pandemic by embracing and prioritizing the rollout of the \"effective vaccine\" inherited from the Trump presidency),[147] and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.[69] However, Hannity subsequently walked back his remarks on his radio show and Hannity, arguing that he never urged his viewers to get the vaccine, and adding the caveat that they should get the vaccine \"if it's right for you\", after doing \"all of your research\" and speaking with medical professionals that they trust.[148][149]On July 26, 2021, a number of organizations announced that they would mandate the vaccination of their employees, including the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association, and frontline health care workers of the Department of Veterans Affairs. California and New York City announced that all government employees would be subject to weekly testing if they are not vaccinated.[150][151]On July 29, President Biden similarly announced that unvaccinated federal employees and on-site contractors will be subject to mandatory social distancing, masks, weekly or bi-weekly COVID-19 testing, and limitations on work travel.[152] Biden cited Delta variant and a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\" as justification for the measures. He also announced that the federal government planned to use funds from the American Rescue Plan to reimburse small and medium-sized businesses for paid time off for employee vaccine appointments (similar to paid time off provided for voting in elections), and called for states to offer $100 payments to the newly vaccinated using American Rescue Plan funding as an \"extra incentive to boost vaccination rates, protect communities, and save lives.\" Biden stated that \"I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks that have gotten vaccinated already but here's the deal: if incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them.\"[153][154][155]On August 1, the CDC reported that there had been a 24% week-over-week increase in the number of first doses administered, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. As of August 2, at least 70% of U.S. adults had received at least one vaccine dose.[156] On August 6, the CDC reported that half of the U.S population has been fully vaccinated.[157]\nSeveral major cities announced or approved plans to restrict access to non-essential indoor locations such as cinemas, restaurants, and other entertainment venues, to those who are vaccinated.[158][159][160]The FDA gave full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on August 23 for patients 16 and older, prompting President Biden to encourage those who had been waiting for full approval to get vaccinated.[161] Anthony Fauci projected that at least 20% of unvaccinated Americans \"will now step forward and get vaccinated\" due to the approval.[162] With the approval, it was also announced that the Department of Defense was preparing guidance requiring the vaccination of military members for COVID-19, with press secretary John Kirby stating that this would \"ensure the safety of our service members and promote the readiness of our force, not to mention the health and safety of the communities around the country in which we live.\"[163]On October 20, the White House said it had enough Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric vaccine for every child in the country age 5\u201311 and that it expected federal health officials to approve the vaccine within weeks, upon which approval the White House planned to begin distributing the doses.[164] Dr. Fauci said on October 24 that it seemed likely that the FDA might approve the vaccine for distribution in early November.[165] On October 29, 2021, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age.[166]  Vice President Harris received her booster shot of the Moderna vaccine on October 30.On August 9, 2021, all servicemembers received a memo explaining that, under a plan endorsed by President Biden and by military leadership, COVID-19 vaccination would become mandatory within about a month.[168] About a third of active U.S. military service members had already been vaccinated as of late April;[169] and about two-thirds (73% of all service members) had already been vaccinated by the time the memo was sent.[170]The U.S. Navy had been the fastest to begin vaccination in early 2021. As of April 22, 2021, considering active military personnel who had received at least one dose, the U.S. Navy had the highest percentage at 51%, the Marines at 36%, the Air Force/Space Force at 34%, and the Army at 27%.[169] By late May, at least 58% of active military personnel had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.[171]As of April 9, 2021, 39% of U.S. Marines to whom the military offered the vaccine had refused it. The highest rate of refusal was at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where 57% of Marines had refused the vaccine.[172]On August 23, 2021, the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine got its full FDA approval, prompting vaccinations to be required for all active duty, reserve, and National Guard troops starting August 25.[173] By the time the vaccination requirement order was sent out, only 68% of active-duty troops were fully vaccinated.[174]On September 1, 2021, the U.S. Navy mandated vaccination of all active-duty Navy sailors and U.S. Marines by November 28 and of reservists by December 28.[175] On September 3, 2021, the U.S. Air Force mandated vaccination of all active-duty airmen and U.S. Space Force Guardians by November 2, while Air Force reservists had until December 2.[176] On September 14, 2021, the U.S. Army mandated vaccination of all active duty soldiers by December 15 and of reservists by June 30, 2022.[177]The U.S. does not issue a federally mandated COVID-19 certificate nor a digital proof that would allow venues to check the vaccine status of participants consistently. CDC vaccine cards that contain personal information including patient numbers and place of vaccinations are accepted in those European countries where American military personnel are stationed. However, those cards are not immediately transferrable to EU Digital COVID Certificates since CDC cards are not digitally validated and do not contain a counterfeit-proof or unique identifier. Asian countries have similar health certificate requirements for entering their territories. The lack of a federal system for checking COVID-19 status has put the United States in a disadvantage compared to nations in Europe and Asia.[178]The Kaiser Family Foundation conducts ongoing polling and analysis in a project called the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor.[179] It considers demographics including age, race, political party, education, and insurance status when examining vaccine hesitancy.[180] A KFF study in December 2020 showed that 27% of the general public, and 29% of health careworkers, were hesitant to be vaccinated.[181][182]In December 2020 a Gallup poll found that 63% of Americans were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.[182]Safety concerns about the currently available vaccines are a primary factor in vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Most unvaccinated adults are not confident in the safety of the available vaccines and while 63% of parents are confident the vaccines are safe for adults only about half of those who are confident in safety for adults are confident they are safe for ages 12-17 and its further reduced for even younger age groups. The need for more research for the vaccines is the most stated reason given by parents for not wanting to have their child vaccinated.[183]Political leanings are reflected in vaccine hesitancy. Early in the pandemic, before vaccines were available, a poll conducted May 20\u201321, 2020, found that 44% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats believed a debunked conspiracy theory that Bill Gates was plotting to use a COVID-19 vaccine to inject microchips into the population.[184] Months after vaccination began, a Monmouth poll conducted April 8\u201312, 2021, found that two-thirds of Democratic voters had already been vaccinated but only one-third of Republican voters had done so.[185] A Quinnipiac poll conducted on the same dates found that 45% of Republicans said they did not plan to be vaccinated.[186] The New York Times wrote that the vaccination program was \"hitting what appears to be a soft ceiling\" as it moved to dealing with the demographic groups where vaccine hesitancy was stronger.[187]In January 2021, approximately one third of the population was concerned the vaccine might be made mandatory.[188]A Frank Luntz poll in mid-April 2021 found a rise in vaccine confidence from the previous month, despite the pause of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.[189]A later poll by The Washington Post and ABC News found that 86% of self-identified Democrats surveyed had received at least one dose, as opposed to 45% of self-identified Republicans.[133][132]In July 2021, The New York Times noted that there were two groups of Americans who remained hesitant to get the vaccine, the first group being \"a mix of people but tend to be disproportionately white, rural, evangelical Christian and politically conservative\" and the second group being \"a broad range of people, but tend to be a more diverse and urban group, including many younger people, Black and Latino Americans, and Democrats.\"[190]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden": "Joe Biden's tenure as the 46th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2021.[1][2] Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president under Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump. He was inaugurated alongside Kamala Harris, the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American vice president.[3] Biden entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization.[4]On the first day of his presidency, Biden made an effort to revert President Trump's energy policy by restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also halted funding for Trump's border wall, an expansion of the Mexican border wall.[5] On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days.[6]Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19.[7] He also signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; a ten-year plan to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access.[8] He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court. Biden proposed an expansion of the social safety net through the Build Back Better Plan, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. In foreign policy, Biden completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia.[9][10][11] However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to Biden receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia.Biden announced his candidacy in April 2019, having previously sought the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, being unsuccessful both times.[12]On November 7, four days after Election Day, Biden was projected to have defeated the incumbent president Donald Trump, becoming president-elect of the United States[13][14][15][16][17] with 306 of the total 538 electoral votes, and 81,268,924 popular votes versus 74,216,154 votes for Trump. The Trump campaign launched at least 63 lawsuits against the results,[18] especially in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada and Michigan, raising unevidenced claims of widespread voter fraud that were subsequently dismissed by courts.[19][20]Though Biden was generally acknowledged as the winner,[14][15][16][17] General Services Administration head Emily W. Murphy initially refused to begin the transition to the president-elect, thereby denying funds and office space to his team.[21][22] On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition.[23]Two days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, Biden announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University's Marcella Nunez-Smith.[24]On January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term.[25][26] President-elect Biden had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.[27][28]On January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently broke into the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden's election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes.[29] More than 26,000 National Guard members were deployed to the capital for the inauguration, with thousands remaining into the spring.[30]On January 20, 2021, Biden was sworn in by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts as the 46th president of the United States, completing the oath of office at 11:49 AM EST, eleven minutes before the legal start of his term.[31][32]Biden's inaugural speech laid out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice.[33] Biden called for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of political, demographic, and ideological American cultures through a greater embrace of diversity.[34] He cited the American Civil War, Great Depression, world wars, and September 11 attacks as moments in American history where citizens' \"better angels\" prevailed, saying that the unity, the solution, must again be invoked to rise from the \"cascading\" crises of the present; this unity, he proclaimed, exists in the \"common objects\" that define America: \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and ... truth.\"[35][36] He explicitly decried white supremacy and nativism, calling them an \"ugly reality\" of American life he vows to defeat that clouds the \"American ideal\" set out in the U.S. Declaration of Independence \u2014 that all Americans are equal.[34][36][37] Biden pledged that the U.S. would \"engage with the world once again\", \"repair our alliances\", and act as a \"trusted partner for peace and security.\"[38] Near the conclusion of his speech, Biden held a moment of silence for those who died in the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] Quoting the Gene Scheer composition \"American Anthem\",[39] he implored Americans to consider their legacy in answering the \"call of history\" to protect \"democracy, hope, truth, and justice\", \"secure liberty\", and make America a \"beacon to the world\", insisting that generations of their descendants would judge them on their actions.[35]The full text of Joe Biden's Inaugural Address at Wikisource.On November 11, 2020, Biden selected Ron Klain, who served as his vice presidential chief of staff, to serve as his White House Chief of Staff.[40] Biden chose Jen Psaki, deputy White House press secretary and U.S. Department of State spokesperson during the presidency of Barack Obama, as his White House press secretary. Psaki announced, and has held, daily press briefings for White House reporters. On March 25, 2021, Biden held his first solo press conference after 64 days in office,[41] unlike his most recent predecessors (back to Herbert Hoover in 1929), who all held their first solo press conferences within 33 days of taking office.[42][43]On November 17, 2020, Biden announced that he had selected Mike Donilon as senior advisor and Steve Ricchetti as counselor.[44] Jen O'Malley Dillon, who had served as campaign manager for Biden's successful presidential campaign, was named as deputy chief of staff.[45]Biden selected Antony Blinken to be secretary of state, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the United Nations, and Jake Sullivan as national security advisor.[46][47]On November 23, 2020, Biden announced Alejandro Mayorkas to be his choice for Secretary of Homeland Security and Avril Haines as Director of National Intelligence.[48] Throughout December and January, Biden continued to select cabinet members, including Marty Walsh, the then current mayor of Boston, as his Secretary of Labor.[49][50]Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and ambassador to the United Nations as cabinet-level positions.[51][52][53] Biden removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his official cabinet.[54]While administering the oath of office to hundreds of White House officials through video conferencing, Biden called for more civility in politics, saying: \"If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot. ... No ifs, ands, or buts.\"[55]Biden strongly campaigned for the presidency on the public option, a policy that, if enacted into law, would have offered Americans a choice between maintaining their private healthcare insurance or buying into Medicare. The idea was viewed as a compromise between the progressive and moderate flanks of the Democratic Party. The Biden campaign described the public option as a \"plan to protect and build on ObamaCare.\"[65]However, shortly before taking office in January 2021, Biden's team abruptly dropped the proposal, frustrating many online progressives who already viewed the public option healthcare proposal as a failure to fight the status quo.[66]The Biden administration rescinded work requirements for Medicaid recipients.[67] The administration opened a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act as well as extending the normal enrollment period, citing the COVID-19 pandemic.[68][69] The administration provided larger premium subsidies.[70]On January 20, 2021, his first day as president, Biden implemented a federal mask mandate, requiring the use of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors.[71][72][5] Biden also signed an executive order that reversed the withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO), making Dr. Anthony Fauci the head of the delegation to the WHO.[72] On January 21, the administration released a 200-page document titled \"National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness\".[73][74] On his second day in office, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up the vaccination process and ensure the availability of glass vials, syringes, and other vaccine supplies at the federal level.[75][76] In justifying his use of the act, Biden said: \"And when I say wartime, people kind of look at me like 'wartime?' Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. 400,000. This is a wartime undertaking.\"[77] Biden established the White House COVID-19 Response Team, a White House Office dedicated to coordinating a unified federal government response.[78]On January 21, 2021, Biden signed ten executive orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.[79] In order to meet his vaccination goal of a hundred million shots in his first 100 days in office, Biden signed an executive order increasing needed supplies.[6][80] Biden signed an order on January 21 that directed FEMA to offer full reimbursements to states for the cost of using their own National Guard personnel and emergency supplies such as Personal Protective Equipment in schools.[6][81] On January 24, 2021, Biden reinstated a travel ban imposed by President Trump on Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, and 26 other European countries.[82][83][84] The travel ban prevents non-U.S. citizens living in the prospective countries from entering the U.S.[85] Biden implemented a face mask requirement on nearly all forms of public transportation and inside of transportation hubs; previously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recommended that such a policy be enacted but it was blocked by the Trump administration, under which the CDC issued strong, albeit non-binding recommendations for mask use in these settings.[86]In mid-March 2021, Biden dismissed a request by the European Union to export unused COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca out of the U.S. even though the manufacturer endorsed it and vowed to resupply the doses. The rationale for this decision, which contributed to low European vaccination rates, was that the U.S. had to be \"over-supplied and over-prepared\", according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.[87] Whereas the U.S. exported no vaccines, the European Union exported 77 million doses to the world from December 2020 to March 2021.[88] Eventually, the U.S. reversed course and gave vaccine doses from AstraZeneca to Mexico, Canada, and Japan by the end of March.[89]On May 6, 2021, the Biden administration\u00a0announced that it supports waiving patent protections on existing COVID-19 vaccines so that other countries can produce generic variants, following weeks of pressure from the international community.[90] On 7 May, French president Emmanuel Macron called on the U.S. \"to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production.\"[91]On May 26, 2021, Biden\u00a0ordered\u00a0U.S. intelligence agencies\u00a0to increase their investigations into the\u00a0origin of the virus, following reports that researchers at the\u00a0Wuhan Institute of Virology\u00a0became ill a month before the pandemic began.[92]In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the U.S. has \"a pandemic for those who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated, touting the vaccines' effectiveness against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.[93] He also criticized the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, saying it was \"killing people\".[94]Despite months of vaccine availability and incentives, by September many Americans continued to resist vaccination amid rising cases in several states, hampering prospects towards herd immunity. On September 9, Biden stated, \"We\u2019ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us.\" That day he issued an executive order directing businesses with more than 100 employees to require vaccination of their workers or weekly testing, affecting about 80 million Americans. The order also required the roughly 17 million employees of health facilities receiving federal Medicare or Medicaid to be vaccinated.[95] Many Republicans asserted Biden's order was an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority, and some Republican governors said they would sue to block it.[96]The Biden administration responded to the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in December 2021 by advocating for a state-level response over a federal level response.[97] Throughout the surge, the Biden administration has been criticized for a lack of COVID-19 tests, exacerbating the spread of the Omicron variant. When questioned about the apparent shortage of tests, Jen Psaki replied, \u201cShould we just send one to every American? Then what happens if every American has one test? How much does that cost and what happens after that?\u201d,[98] causing backlash.[99] The Biden administration responded by promising an increased supply of at-home tests later in 2022.[100]In the midst of an all-time high of new COVID-19 cases,[101] the Centers for Disease Control revised their guidelines, recommending five days of quarantine rather than ten without requiring a negative COVID-19 test.[102] This move was criticized by health experts who worry that without rapid testing, COVID-positive people may unknowingly spread COVID-19 in workplaces under the recommended CDC guidelines. Others criticize the CDC for implementing this change following lobbying by Delta Airlines, leading to social media backlash against the federal government.[103]On January 22, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump's policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions.[104][105][106] Biden's executive order also promotes a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and repeals three of Trump's executive orders which made the employee discipline process stricter and restricted union representatives' access to office space. As well as promoting a $15 minimum wage, Biden's executive order increases the amount of money going to the families of children who are missing meals because of school closures due to the pandemic by 15%.[107] The repealing of Trump's three executive orders comes as the orders were used to transfer civil servants and career scientists and replace them with employees friendly to the Trump administration.[108]Some analysts, such as Alexander Nazaryan, noted that Biden's COVID-19 relief package bill is $100 billion bigger than then-Obama's top economic adviser Christina Romer's $1.8 trillion 2009 stimulus package, which was reduced to $800 billion after another top economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, rejected it as too big. On spending, among others, Biden broke with both Obama and Trump, even as many Obama alumni are part of the new administration, and was seen as maintaining the promise Biden made when he said that his presidential term would not be \"a third Obama term\" because \"President Trump has changed the landscape.\"[109]The S&P 500 stock market index increased 37.4% during the first year after Biden's election, the best first-year performance after a presidential election on record.[110]On January 14, 2021, Biden revealed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[111] The plan includes $1 trillion in direct aid, including $1,400 per-person checks, for working Americans, and would provide for direct housing and nutrition assistance, expanding access to safe and reliable childcare and affordable healthcare, increasing the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, and giving families with kids and childless workers an emergency boost this year.[112][113] It would also expand the eligibility of these checks to adult dependents who have been left out of previous rounds of relief.[112][113][111] The plan additionally includes $440 billion in community support, providing $350 billion of community support to first responders while the rest goes to grants for small businesses and transit agencies; $400 billion for a national vaccination plan and school reopenings; and $10 billion for information technology, modernizing federal cybersecurity infrastructure.[111][113] In her first press briefing, press secretary Psaki said the plan was likely to change.[114]The plan invokes the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the production of personal protective equipment, glass vials, syringes, and other supplies exceeds the demand.[112] It allows partners of states to create vaccine centers in stadiums, convention centers and pharmacies.[75] The federal government would identify communities that have been hit hardest by COVID-19, and ensure the vaccine does not reach them at an unfair pace.[113][112][75] In addition, the plan would launch a national campaign to educate Americans about the vaccine and COVID-19, targeting misinformation related to the pandemic.[75] Vaccines would also be freely available to all citizens regardless of immigration status.[112] In Biden's plan, he would issue a national testing strategy that attempts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by increasing laboratory capacity and expanding testing. The plan would also develop new treatments for COVID-19.[112][111][113][75]No Republican in Congress voted for the American Rescue Plan.[115] While debates and negotiations over the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 were ongoing, some Republicans, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Donald Trump Jr., and Rep. Madison Cawthorn, focused instead on the decision by the Dr. Seuss estate to stop publishing what many viewed as a racially-offensive Dr. Seuss book and the re-branding of the \"Mr. Potato Head\" toy.[116][117] Biden signed the Plan into law on March 11, 2021.[118] The provision to increase the minimum wage was excluded from the relief plan.Biden signed an executive order intended to support domestic manufacturers by increasing a federal preference for purchasing goods made wholly or partly in the U.S. Using the broad term \"Made in America laws\", the executive order's stated goal is to strengthen \"all statutes, regulations, rules, and Executive Orders relating to Federal financial assistance awards or Federal procurement, including those that refer to 'Buy America' or 'Buy American.'\"[119][120]The Wall Street Journal reported that instead of negotiating access to Chinese markets for large American financial-service firms and pharmaceutical companies, the Biden administration may focus on trade policies that boost exports or domestic jobs. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the administration wants a \"worker-centered trade policy.\"[121][122] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said she planned to aggressively enforce trade rules to combat unfair practices by China.[123]In March 2021, in her first interview since taking office, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told The Wall Street Journal the U.S. would not lift tariffs on Chinese imports in the near future, despite lobbying efforts from \"free traders\" including former U.S. Secretary of Treasury Hank Paulson and the Business Roundtable, a big-business group in the U.S., that pressed for tariff repeal.[124]In 2021, the U.S. suspended its diplomatic trade engagement with Myanmar following an escalation in violence perpetrated by the Burmese military against anti-coup protesters.[125]As a part of the Build Back Better Plan, the Biden administration aimed for massive spending on the nation's infrastructure on the order of $2 trillion.[126] Several of the physical infrastructure provisions featured in the proposal were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Biden signed the Act into law on November 15, 2021.[127]On 28 April, during Biden's speech to Congress he unveiled the American Families Plan, a roughly $1.8 trillion proposal to significantly increase federal spending in areas related to childcare, paid leave, pre-kindergarten, community college, and healthcare.[128][129] It is considered to be the third part of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda (the first being the American Rescue Plan and the second being the American Jobs Plan).[130] The bill was effectively merged with climate change and other provisions that didn't make it into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, for a total $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act. However, the bill did not have Republican support, and Democrats struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[131] After the bill ultimately failed to match his envisioned cost, Manchin publicly rejected it, dooming its passage.[132]Finance officials from 130 countries agreed on July 1, 2021, to plans for a new international taxation policy. All the major economies agreed to pass national laws that would require corporations to pay at least 15% income tax in the countries they operate. This new policy would end the practice of locating world headquarters in small countries with very low taxation rates. Governments hope to recoup some of the lost revenue, estimated at $100 billion to $240 billion each year. The new system was promoted by the Biden Administration and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Secretary-General Mathias Cormann of the OECD said: \"This historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere.\"[133]Between January 2021 and January 2022, the United States Consumer Price Index rose 7.5%, which was the highest rate in forty years.[134]  Biden originally \"misread\" the threat of inflation and considered it a temporary side effect of a recovering economy.[135]  The Wall Street Journal criticized Biden for dismissing the inflation as \"transitory\" and for his policy of \"massively expanding the money supply and over-stimulating demand.\"[136] Biden stated during his first State of the Union Address on March 1, 2022 that addressing inflation was his \"top priority,\" while touting an anti-inflation plan that he said would address ocean shipping costs and prescription drug prices.[137]In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration announced a ban on Russian oil and gas imports to the United States, an action that one analyst said risked \"higher oil prices for American consumers.\"[138]Biden advocated more domestic production to lower inflation, but at the same time, he designed stringent import stops for Russian energy. As of March 2022, Iran and Venezuela were still barred by sanctions from selling much of their crude oil into the international market. Political analysts fear that such posturing on Russian energy and international sanctions would only lead to a wider conflict. Similarly, wheat prices hit a 14-year high, as food shortage fears rose worldwide. Economists warn that both a reduction in wheat supply from the Ukraine and strict financial sanctions against Russia would lead to a worsening of the global food supply.[139][140]During his first week in office, Biden established the position of White House National Climate Advisor, appointing environmental health and air quality expert Gina McCarthy to the role. Biden also created the position of U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, appointing former Secretary of State John Kerry.[141]On January 20, 2021, Biden signed an executive order rejoining the U.S. to the Paris Agreement.[142][143] With the U.S. rejoining the agreement, countries responsible for two-thirds of the global greenhouse gas emissions would make pledges of becoming carbon neutral, while without United States it is only half.[144] On the same day, Biden also issued an executive order that cancelled the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, an extension of the Keystone Pipeline. The pipeline was heavily criticized by environmental and Native American activists and groups.[145][146] This order also directed agencies to review and reverse more than 100 actions made by Trump on the environment.[72]On January 21, 2021, the Biden administration issued a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases and permits on federal land and waters.[147] On January 27, 2021, Biden signed a number of executive orders aimed at combating climate change,[148] one of them setting climate change as a key consideration for U.S. national security and foreign policy.[149] In an attempt to encourage U.S. membership to the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement aimed to reduce the production of hydrofluorocarbons, Biden's executive order directed the U.S. Department of State to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate.[150][151]In March 2021, 21 Republican state attorneys general of 21 states sued the Biden administration for revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit. The suit claims Biden's executive order exceeded his authority.[152][153]On March 27, 2021, Biden invited more than forty world leaders for a climate summit.[154] The Biden administration supported the Line 3 pipeline, which transports oil from Canada's oil sands region.[155]In May 2021, the EPA rolled back a Trump administration rule that prohibited the EPA from using certain studies.[156][157] The previous rule, which made it more difficult to use major scientific studies to justify pollution reduction policies,[158] had already been invalidated by a federal court.[159]On June 1, 2021, Secretary of the Interior\u00a0Deb Haaland\u00a0suspended all oil and gas drilling leases in\u00a0Alaska's\u00a0Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, pending further review of their environmental impacts.[160]In January 2021, Biden had issued a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases and permits on federal land and waters. A group of Republican state attorneys general successfully obtained a decision in federal court to lift the moratorium. The Biden administration appealed the decision but agreed to continue with the sales, and in September 2021 held the largest federal gas and oil lease auction in U.S. history, selling leases to extract 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The areas that were purchased by oil companies can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. The administration has also proposed another round of gas and oil lease sales in 2022, in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states.[161][162][163] In November 2021, a closely watched Interior Department report on federal oil and gas lease policy, ordered by Biden, was completed. The report recommended increasing the 12.5% federal royalty rate for oil and gas drilling, which had not been raised by a century, and was significantly lower than rates charged for leasing on state and private land. The report also recommended an increase in the bond rates that drilling companies are required to pay for future cleanup efforts before beginning extraction at new sites, and recommended that leases be focused on sites with \"moderate to high potential\" for production in proximity to existing fossil-fuel infrastructure.[163] The report stopped short of banning the leasing program, which generates billions of dollars for the federal government, but reformed its terms to be less favorable for industry; environmental groups praised the reforms, but also said they were insufficient to address the U.S. contribution to the climate crisis.[163]In 2021, the Biden administration proposed a 20-year ban on oil and gas drilling around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, a site in northwestern New Mexico that contain important Ancestral Puebloan sites.[164]The Biden administration set a goal of achieving 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generated in the U.S. by 2030 (sufficient to provide electricity to about 10 million homes). In 2021, the Biden administration approved the South Fork Wind project, a major (130 MW, 12-turbine) commercial offshore wind power project located southeast of Rhode Island's Block Island and east of New York's Montauk Point, the wind farm is projected to provide electricity to proved 70,000 Long Island homes. The project is the country's second large-scale offshore wind project (after a similar wind-power development in Massachusetts.[165][166]In November 2021, Biden promised to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030,[167] joining more than 100 other global leaders in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.[168][169]In response to what Biden describes as the growing influence of special interests and gerrymandering in elections, he has pledged to seek electoral and government ethics reforms.[170] Biden supported the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.[171][172] In January 2022, he endorsed a change to senate filibuster rules after they both failed to invoke cloture.[173] However, the rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[174] Biden has suggested that the 2022 United States elections could be illegitimate if these laws are not passed.[175][176][177]On January 20, 2021, Biden halted the construction of the U.S.\u2013Mexico barrier[72] and ended a related national emergency declared by Trump in February 2018.[5] Biden issued a proclamation that ended the Trump travel ban imposed on predominantly Muslim countries in January 2017.[72][5] Biden also reaffirmed protections to recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.[178] The same day, Biden sent a memorandum to the U.S. Department of State reinstating Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians.[179][180]On January 20, 2021, the Biden administration issued a moratorium on deportations from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the first 100 days of his presidency.[181] On January 22, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration for violating Biden's written pledge to cooperatively work with the state of Texas.[182] A federal judge in Texas subsequently issued a temporary restraining order barring the Biden administration from enforcing its moratorium, citing the lack of \"any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations.\"[183]On January 21, 2021, Biden proposed a bill that, if passed, would replace the word alien with noncitizen in U.S. immigration law.[184][185] The following day, Biden had a call with Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. On the call, Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador spoke about immigration, where Biden spoke of reducing immigration from Mexico to the U.S. by targeting what Biden deemed as root causes.[186] According to an Associated Press report, L\u00f3pez Obrador noted that Biden pledged $4 billion to \"help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States.\"[187]On January 23, Biden proposed an immigration bill[188] aiming to give a path to citizenship to eleven million immigrants living in the U.S. without a permanent legal status.[188] The bill would also make it easier for certain foreign workers to stay in the U.S.[189][190] Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin called the bill \"aspirational\". It is widely expected not to pass both houses of Congress without significant revision.[188][189][190]Biden instructed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus on violent offenders of immigration laws rather than all offenders of immigration laws.[191][192]In February 2021, it was reported that DHS agents who had been empowered by Trump to enact his anti-immigration policies were resisting and defying Biden's immigration policies.[191] The union representing ICE agents signaled that its agents would not accept reversals of Trump policies.[191]In March 2021, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to Venezuelans fleeing the country amidst the ongoing political and economic crisis.[193]On June 1, 2021, the\u00a0DHS officially terminated the\u00a0Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which mandated that all\u00a0asylum seekers\u00a0from\u00a0Central America\u00a0were to wait in\u00a0Mexico\u00a0pending their court cases; however, a health order from March 2020 allowed the border authorities to send migrants back for the duration of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0have remained in place.[194][195] However, on August 14, 2021, a federal judge in Texas ordered the Biden administration to reimplement the policy; the Supreme Court placed a pause on the ruling to give the administration time for arguments.[196][197] On August 24, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration must comply with the lower court's ruling to reinstate the policy.[198][199]Early during Biden's tenure, a surge in unaccompanied minors at the U.S. border stirred controversy. According to a 2021 Politico report, Republicans expected prior to Biden taking office that there would be a border surge at the start of 2021 (due to seasonal patterns and regional crises) and coordinated to make it a central issue in the lead-up to the 2022 mid-term elections.[200] The number of migrants arriving in the U.S. from Central America had been rising since April 2020 due to ongoing violence, natural disasters, food insecurity, and poverty in the region.[201] In February 2021, the U.S. Border Patrol reported a 61% increase in encounters with unaccompanied children from the month before. The reported 5,858 encounters in January to 9,457 in February constituted the largest one-month percentage increase in encounters with unaccompanied children since U.S. Customs and Border Protection began recording data in 2010.[202][203][204] By the end of April 2021, the number of children held in Border Patrol facilities fell by 84%, placing them under HHS care.[205]On March 24, 2021, Biden tasked Vice President Harris to reduce the number of unaccompanied minors and adult asylum seekers. She is also tasked with leading the negotiations with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.[206]The number of migrant families and unaccompanied children entering the U.S. from across the Southwest border steeply declined in August, September, and October 2021.[207][208]As a practicing Catholic,[209] Biden has taken a public position of dissent against the Catholic position opposing free-choice in the abortion issue.[210] Biden's position of dissent has raised the question of whether his public office might allow him to influence the outcomes of debates currently taking place with the Catholic Church concerning the abortion issues.[211] Although the Vatican has taken a mediating position concerning Biden's dissent concerning the free-choice issue by allowing him to take Communion in Rome while visiting the Pope, other local churches such as a local parish in South Carolina have in the past blocked Biden from taking Communion as a public declaration of the Church's position against abortion in an attempt to discourage other parishioners from taking a similar position of dissent against Church policy.[210]During his early days in office, Biden focused on \"advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice and equal opportunity.\" According to The New York Times, Biden's early actions in office focused on racial equality more than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson, who passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[212] On January 25, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that lifted the ban on transgender military service members.[213] This reversed a memorandum imposed by Trump.[214]The Biden administration is seeking to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill.[215][216] This effort follows that of the Obama administration, which was blocked by Steven Mnuchin.[217] Press secretary Psaki said it was important that U.S. money and notes reflect the \"history and diversity\" of the country and that putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill would do so.[218]On January 20, the Biden administration issued an Executive Order entitled Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government[219] increasing the federal government's anti-bias enforcement against government contractors. The intent is heightened investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, more thorough audits, and more detailed follow-up inquiries with government contractors, with an emphasis on combatting pay discrimination.[220]On January 26, Biden directed the U.S. Department of Justice to reduce their usage of private prisons and ordered the attorney general to not renew contracts with private prisons, citing the need to \"reduce profit-based incentives\" for the incarceration of racial minorities.[221][222][223]On March 19, three days after the Atlanta spa shootings that killed 8 people, including 6 Asian women, Biden and Vice President Harris travelled to Atlanta. They spoke to Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates and leaders and condemned sexism, and racism against Asian Americans.[224]On June 17, Biden signed into law a bill creating Juneteenth as a federal holiday; the day celebrates the end of slavery in the U.S.[225]In December 2021, the Biden administration ended a long-standing restriction on sales of abortion pills through the mail. This decision came amidst legal cases and Supreme Court decisions that jeopardized abortion access in the United States.[226]The Biden administration rescinded a Trump administration policy that curtailed the use of consent decrees that had been used by previous administrations in their investigations of misconduct in police departments.[227]Biden proposed in his fiscal 2022 budget to more than double funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program, which helps state and local governments to hire law enforcement officers.[228]In a national address in March 2021, following mass shootings in the Atlanta area and Boulder, Colorado, Biden advocated for further gun regulations, such as a restored ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as reinforcing preexisting background checks.[229][230]The Biden administration reversed the Trump administration's method of using the National Space Council to coordinate commercial, civil, and military space policies, instead using the National Security Council to issue national security memoranda instead of the Space Council's space policy directives.[231] The Biden administration renewed the National Space Council, chaired by Vice President Harris,[232] \"to assist the president in generating national space policies, strategies, and synchronizing America's space activities.\"[233] Harris held meetings with the leaders of five countries to discuss international cooperation on space issues.[232]The Biden administration continued the Artemis program to send people back to the Moon.[232][234] The administration also emphasized the role of NASA in studying climate change.[232][235]Biden appointed Bill Nelson, an astronaut and former U.S. Senator, to the post of NASA administrator. Nelson was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in April 2021.[236]In April 2021, as part of his first annual budget request, Biden proposed a $24.8 billion budget for NASA in 2022, a $1.5 billion increase on what Congress allocated to 2021.[235][237] The proposal includes funding for the Artemis program for a new crewed Moon landing mission.[237] The proposal also included a 12.5% increase for NASA's Earth Science Division, as well as a 22% increase for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates a fleet of weather satellites; both measures aimed to use space tools to study and mitigate climate change.[235]On January 22, 2021, Biden signed his first bill,[238] H.R. 335 into law, providing a waiver to the law preventing appointment of a Secretary of Defense who had been on active duty in the armed forces within the past seven years;[239] this was the third time such a waiver was granted by Congress. Retired army four-star general Lloyd Austin was confirmed by the Senate in a 93\u20132 vote that same day, making Austin the first African-American Defense Secretary.[240][238]Austin has said his number one priority is to assist COVID-19 relief efforts, pledging he would \"quickly review the Department's contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts, ensuring that we're doing everything that we can to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness.\"[241]On February 10, 2021, Biden visited the Pentagon for the first time as U.S. president.[242] In remarks to service members alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Biden announced a U.S. Department of Defense-led China task force to \"to provide a baseline assessment of department policies, programs and processes in regard to the challenge China poses.\"[243]On June 18, 2021, the administration\u00a0removed eight\u00a0MIM-104 Patriot anti-missile batteries\u00a0from\u00a0Saudi Arabia,\u00a0Jordan,\u00a0Kuwait, and\u00a0Iraq, removed the\u00a0THAAD\u00a0anti-missile defense system from Saudi Arabia, and announced that most jet squadrons and hundreds of\u00a0American troops\u00a0would be withdrawn from the region. The changes come in light of both de-escalating tensions with\u00a0Iran\u00a0and the administration changing its focus on countering\u00a0China.[244]After taking office, Biden heavily restricted the use of armed drones and drone strikes.[245][246] After Biden's first year in office, drone strikes had hit a 20-year low and were heavily limited by the administration.[247][248]Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China and build \"a united front of U.S. allies and partners to confront China's abusive behaviors and human rights violations.\"[249] He described China as the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges on the \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\" of the U.S.[250]Biden nominated Antony Blinken to serve as Secretary of State who took office on January 26, 2021.[251][252] During his nomination hearing, Blinken said that previous optimistic approaches to China were flawed,[253] and that Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, \"was right in taking a tougher approach to China\" but he \"disagree[s] very much with the way [Trump] went about it in a number of areas.\"[252] He endorsed former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's report that China is committing a genocide against Uyghur Muslims.[252]In March 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and other administration officials met with the Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and other Chinese officials in Alaska with heated exchanges on China's human rights abuses, cyberattacks, its threats against Taiwan, its crackdown in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and other issues of U.S. interest. The Chinese side countered: \"The U.S. does not have the qualification to speak to China from a position of strength [and] does not serve as a model to others [and] China's development and strengthening is unstoppable.\"[254][255]The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration got \"a taste of China's 'wolf warrior' diplomacy\" during the first meeting with its Chinese counterpart, which was \"remarkably undiplomatic\", adding \"China's diplomats appeared more forceful than they had been in any public meeting during President Trump's term.\"[256] The Atlantic published an article saying that the Biden team \"flushed Beijing's true intentions out into the open for the world to see\", quoting a senior administration official's comment that it is \"increasingly difficult to argue that we don't know what China wants.\"[257]In April 2021, it was reported that the Biden administration was rallying U.S. allies in consideration of a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The U.S. Department of State spokesman Ned Price told reporters that a joint boycott \"is something that we certainly wish to discuss.\"[258]In May 2021, the administration removed Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi from the Chinese military blacklist, reversing the previous administration's decision.[259]On June 3, 2021, Biden announced an executive order that would come into effect from August 2, and ban Americans from investing into 59 Chinese firms, including\u00a0Huawei. Before it was announced, China said it would retaliate against it.[260]In October 2021, Biden said he is concerned about Chinese hypersonic missiles, days after China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that circled the globe before speeding towards its target.[261]The Biden administration has kept the sanctions against Cuba that were issued by the previous presidential administration, despite one of Biden's campaign promises being to lift restrictions against the country.[262][263]In June 2021, the Biden administration continued America's tradition of voting against an annual United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for an end to the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba.[264] The resolution was adopted for the 29th time with 184 votes in favor, three abstentions, and two no votes: the U.S. and Israel.[265]In July 2021, protesters gathered in front of the White House and demonstrators called on President Joe Biden to take action in Cuba.[266] The Biden administration sanctioned a key Cuban official and a government special forces unit known as the Boinas Negras for human rights abuses in the wake of historic protests on the island.[267] On July 22, 2021, directly before hosting a meeting with Cuban American leaders,[268] President Biden stated \"I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence.\"[269] President Biden has also ordered government specialists to develop ideas for the U.S. to unilaterally extend internet access on the island, and he has promised to enhance backing for Cuban dissidents.[270]In August 2021, Biden sanctioned three additional Cuban officials who were also reportedly involved in the suppression of anti-government protesters in Cuba.[271]In December 2021, 114 Democratic House members signed a letter that urged President Biden to lift restrictions and sanctions against Cuba in order to make their access to food and medicine easier.[263]In February 2020, the Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[273] In April 2021, President Biden formally announced that American troops would instead withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, which would signal an end to the\u00a0U.S.'s longest war.[274] According to Princeton professor Julian E. Zelizer, Biden \"clearly learned a great deal from his time in the Obama presidency\", and demonstrated that \"he is a politician capable of learning and evolving, contrary to some of the skeptics in the primaries who thought he didn't understand how politics had changed.\" According to Washington Post journalist Steven Levingston, \"Obama listened to military leaders who advised him that withdrawal would be a mistake. Biden, meanwhile, was the top administration official arguing for a much more limited role for American forces in Afghanistan. Later, Biden would go on to say that he could tell by Obama's 'body language' that he agreed with that assessment \u2014 even though he ultimately rejected it.\"[109]Soon after the withdrawal of U.S. troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces.[275][276] President Biden defended the withdrawal, saying \"I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and ... more competent in terms of conducting war.\"[277]By early July 2021, most of the American troops in Afghanistan were withdrawn.[273] Biden addressed the withdrawal, stating that: \"The likelihood there\u2019s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[273] On August 15, amid an offensive by the Taliban, the Afghan government collapsed, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and Kabul fell to the Taliban.[273][278] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[279] He has been criticized over the manner of the American withdrawal.[278]On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it (\"the buck stops with me\"), and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[278][280] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\", since the \"Afghan military collapsed [against the Taliban], sometimes without trying to fight\".[280][281] Biden partly attributed the lack of early evacuation of Afghan civilians to the Afghan government's opposition of a \"mass exodus\" which they thought would cause a \"crisis of confidence\".[281]On 26 August, a suicide attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 people, including at least 62 Afghan civilians, 13 US service members, two British nationals and the child of a third British national.[282][283] Biden made a public address following the attack, in which he honoured the American service members who were killed, calling them \"heroes\" and saying they lost their lives \"in the service of liberty\", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others. He expressed deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well. Biden said to those who wished harm upon the US that \"we will hunt you down and make you pay.\"[284] Biden received increasingly harsh criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress, with Republicans calling for his resignation or for his impeachment.[285][286][287]After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, blocking the Taliban from accessing these billions of dollars in reserves held in U.S. bank accounts.[288][289]In February 2022, Biden signed an executive order that seeks to unfreeze approximately $3.5 billion of Afghan assets in the U.S. for the purpose of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan.[290]On April 24, 2021, the Biden administration declared that the Turkish killings of Armenians at the start of the 20th century were a genocide. He is the first U.S. president to ever officially recognize the Armenian genocide.[291]In March 2021, Biden held a virtual meeting with leaders of Japan, India and Australia, an alliance of countries known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad, that work together to address China's expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.[292][293] A few days later, the administration officials, including secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, met with U.S. allies in Asia and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials.[294][254] Austin also visited India to deepen the defense ties between the two countries.[293] In September 2021, Biden hosted the first in-person meeting of Quad at the White House.[295]On the day of Biden's inauguration, the Russian government urged the new U.S. administration to take a \"more constructive\" approach in talks over the extension of the 2010 New START treaty, the sole remaining agreement limiting the number of U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear warheads.[296] In Biden's first telephone call as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on January 26, 2021, Biden and Putin agreed to extend the New START treaty (which was set to expire in February 2021) by an additional five years.[297]Biden and his administration condemned human rights violations by the Russian authorities, calling for the release of detained dissident and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, his wife, and the thousands of Russians who had demonstrated in his support; the U.S. called for the unconditional release of Navalny and the protestors and a credible investigation into Navalny's poisoning.[298][299][300] On March 2, 2021, the U.S. and European Union imposed coordinated additional sanctions on Russian officials, as well as the FSB and GRU, over Navalny's poisoning and imprisonment. The State Department also expanded existing sanctions from the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act that had been imposed after the poisoning of Skripal.[301] The Biden administration is also planning to impose sanctions against Russia because of the 2020 SolarWinds cyberespionage campaign, which compromised the computer systems of nine federal agencies.[302] Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the response \"will include a mix of tools seen and unseen, and it will not simply be sanctions.\"[302][301]The Biden administration's comprehensive review into Russian activities has included an examination of reports that the Russian government offered bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.[303][304] The Biden administration said intelligence community has only \"low to moderate\" confidence in reports due to the fact that the bounty reports originated from \"detainee reporting and because of the difficult operating environment in Afghanistan.\"[305][306] Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"killer\" in an ABC News interview, and said that Russia would pay a price for election meddling.[307]On May 19, 2021, the Biden administration\u00a0lifted CAATSA sanctions on the\u00a0Nord Stream 2\u00a0pipeline project between\u00a0Russia\u00a0and\u00a0Germany. Despite Biden's personal opposition to the project, the\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0says that it concluded that it was in the \"U.S. national interest\" to waive the sanctions.[308] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov welcomed the move as \"a chance for a gradual transition toward the normalisation of our bilateral ties.\"[308]On June 16, 2021, Biden met with Putin in Geneva, Switzerland. The two presidents discussed a number of topics, including stable policy on climate change, nuclear proliferation, and cybersecurity. Russia's activities regarding Ukraine, Alexei Navalny, Belarus, and nationals jailed in each other's countries. The summit was significantly shorter than expected, only lasting three and a half of the predicted five hours.[309] Putin praised Biden as a knowledgeable and shrewd negotiator the next day.[310][311]In November 2021, Putin stated that an expansion of NATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a \"red line\" issue for Russia.[312][313] In December 2021, Putin asked President Joe Biden for legal guarantees that NATO wouldn't expand eastward or put \"weapons systems that threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory.\"[314] The U.S. and NATO have rejected Putin's demands.[315][316]On February 24, 2022, Biden condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying Putin \"chose this war\" and calling him \"the aggressor\". He announced new sanctions against Russia.[317] On February 25, the White House announced the US would personally sanction Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.[318] On February 28, the Biden administration announced sanctions against Russia's central bank, prohibiting Americans from doing business with the bank and freezing the bank's assets.[319] On March 29, 2022 Biden appeared to heighten his condemnation concerning Putin made at the end of his NATO trip to Europe, stating that he makes \"no apologies\" for previously stating that \"Putin cannot remain in power\".[320] On April 12, he called the war a \"genocide\".[321]President Biden promised to repair \"strained\" relationships with European allies in contrast to his predecessor Trump. \"An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakeable vow,\" Biden said, referring to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (the mutual defense clause).[322] Biden pledged support for the European project and for Ukraine's sovereignty as well as the need for global cooperation on fighting the pandemic and climate change.[323]U.S. relations with France deteriorated in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which aimed to counter Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into the agreement, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines. The deal angered the French government, which recalled its ambassador to the U.S. (Philippe \u00c9tienne) as well as the ambassador to Australia. Amid the diplomatic row, the French Foreign Ministry contended that it had been subjected to \"duplicity, disdain and lies\"[324][325] and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the deal a \"stab in the back\".[326] In a conciliatory call a few days later, Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies.[327] A month later, Biden met Macron, telling him his administration was \"clumsy\" and that he was \"under the impression that France had been informed long before\" that France's deal with Australia was \"not going through\".[328]In February 2022, amid rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia, the Biden administration faced questions for its year-long failure to nominate an ambassador to Ukraine.[329]The Biden administration has expressed interest in re-engaging with Iran on the Iran nuclear deal. Biden's predecessor, President Trump, \nwithdrew from the deal in 2018, resulting in swift backlash from international community.[330][331] Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. would be interested in re-entering the agreement so long as Iran shows \"strict compliance\".[332] Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.[333][334]On February 25, 2021, President Biden ordered retaliatory airstrikes on buildings in Syria that the Department of Defense said were used by Iranian-backed militias to carry out rocket attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq. The operation was the first known use of military force by the Biden administration.[335] The attacks prompted condemnation from many Democratic members of Congress. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia questioned the administration's \"legal justification for acting without coming to Congress.\" Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) claimed that \"the Administration should have sought Congressional authorization.\"[336]On February 1, 2021, Biden condemned the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat and called for the release of detained officials. Biden also left open the door to re-imposing sanctions on the country, saying in a statement that \"[t]he United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action.\"[337]On March 5, 2021, Biden imposed sanctions on Myanmar's Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defence and certain junta conglomerates.[338] On March 22, 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions on several military generals in response to a violent crackdown on peaceful protests.[339]Biden has reiterated his commitment to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland by resisting the possibility of a hard border as a result of Brexit. When asked by The Irish Times in March 2021 about comments made by Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney that the UK \"cannot be trusted\" on the Northern Ireland protocol, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that \"President Biden has been unequivocal about his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\" As part of his own Irish-American heritage, Psaki said that Biden \"has a special place in his heart for the Irish\", underpinning his commitment to Northern Ireland's peace.[340]Biden ordered a halt in the arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which the Trump administration had previously agreed to.[341] Two years after Jamal Khashoggi's assassination, Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence under Biden's administration, announced that the intelligence report into the case against Saudi Arabia's government would be declassified. It was reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would be blamed for the murder, as was concluded by the CIA.[342]On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the U.S. was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. President Biden in his first visit to the State Department as president said \"this war has to end\" and that the conflict has created \"a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.\"[343] However, the details of the end of American involvement in the war have yet to be released as of April 2021.[344]In September 2021, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan met in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Bin Salman to discuss the high oil prices.[345] The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19.[346][347]Former adviser to Donald Trump, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. was arrested by the U.S. authorities for his role as a foreign lobbyist for the United Arab Emirates, allowing a foreign nation to meddle in the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. Barrack was also accused of obstruction of justice by giving false statements to the investigators.[348][349] The DOJ also prosecuted some men for funneling more than $3.5 million to Hillary Clinton from George Nader, the royal adviser of the UAE.[350]While federal prosecutors accused the Emirates of interfering in American politics from both sides, the relations with the Arab nation during Biden's presidency didn't witness much of the expected changes. The UAE was seen escaping its blunder-filled history of relations with the US, despite Biden's repetitive criticism against the Emirates' human rights violations and its attempts of infiltrating the US politics.[351] Moreover, the Biden administration also permitted the arms sales of $23 billion to the UAE, which was initiated by Donald Trump and involved a transfer of sophisticated weaponry like the F-35 fighter jets.[352] The US Justice Department did not charge any Emirati in the case. However, Barrack's indictment identified three UAE officials who were hosts at his reception in the Gulf nation after Trump's 2016 elections, and two others who were involved. Amongst the hosts was Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the UAE's national security adviser Tahnoun bin Zayed and director of the Emirati intelligence service, Ali Mohammed Hammad Al Shamsi. The fourth Emirati official was Abdullah Khalifa Al Ghafli, who \u201ctasked\u201d Barrack to push Emirati interests with America. Another official was Yousef Al Otaiba, who asked to remain anonymous in discussions over private matters.[353]Early in the Biden administration, the White House confirmed that the U.S. Embassy would remain in Jerusalem, which would remain recognized as the Capital. The administration also expressed support for the Abraham Accords while wanting to expand on them, although it shied away from using that name, instead referring to it simply as \"the normalization process\".[354][355][356]On 13 May 2021, in the aftermath of the Al-Aqsa mosque conflict, the Biden administration was accused of being indifferent towards the violent conflict between Israeli statehood and the Palestinian minority there. Critics on both sides identified the reaction by the White House as \"lame and late\".[357]On 21 May 2021, a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas after eleven days of clashes. According to Biden, the US will be playing a key role to rebuild damaged infrastructure in the Gaza alongside the Palestinian authority.[358][359]On February 4, 2021, Biden issued a presidential memorandum for expanding protection of LGBT rights worldwide, which includes the possibility to impose financial sanctions.[360]Very early in Biden's presidency, opinion polls found that Biden's approval ratings were steadier than Trump's, with an average approval rating of 55% and an average disapproval rate of 39%.[361] Biden's early approval ratings have been more polarized than Trump's, with 98% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 11% of Republicans approving of Biden's presidency in February 2021, a party gap of 87%.[362] Around the end of his first hundred days in office, Biden's approval rating was higher than Trump's but was the third worst since the presidency of Harry Truman; only Trump and Gerald Ford scored lower.[363][364]Following the fall of Kabul and the surge of COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant in July and August 2021, Biden's approval rating began to steadily decline, from a high of 52.7% approval on July 26, 2021, to 45.9% approval by September 3, 2021, according to FiveThirtyEight.[365][366] While the White House emphasized COVID-19 as causing his low approval rating,[367] inflation, the \nhighest in nearly 40 years,[368][369] has also been described as a cause.[370][371] Biden's current lowest approval rating comes from a Quinnipiac University poll in January 2022, which showed just 33% of respondents approving of his performance as president.[372]By the one-year anniversary of Biden's presidency on January 20, 2022, Gallup recorded the average approval rating for Biden's first year as 49%, which was the second-lowest first-year average approval rating for any American president since World War II; only Trump's first-year average of 38.4% was lower.[373][374] Gallup further noted that there was greater political polarization in Biden's approval ratings than any other first-year president in modern history, with 91% of Democrats supporting Biden while just 8% of Republicans supported him, resulting in a party gap of 83%. The only other year of any presidency that saw greater polarization was Trump's final year in office.[373][375]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Kamala_Harris": "Kamala Devi Harris[a] (/\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0m\u0259l\u0259 \u02c8de\u026avi/ (listen) KAH-m\u0259-l\u0259 DAY-vee;[2][3] born October 20, 1964) is an American politician and attorney who is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. She is the first female vice president and the highest-ranking female official in U.S. history, as well as the first African American and first Asian American vice president.[4][5] A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the attorney general of California from 2011 to 2017 and as a United States senator representing California from 2017 to 2021.Born in Oakland, California, Harris graduated from Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, before being recruited to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and later the City Attorney of San Francisco's office. In 2003, she was elected district attorney of San Francisco. She was elected Attorney General of California in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. Harris served as the junior United States senator from California from 2017 to 2021. Harris defeated Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 Senate election to become the second African American woman and the first South Asian American to serve in the United States Senate.[6][7] As a senator, she advocated for healthcare reform, federal de-scheduling of cannabis, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the DREAM Act, a ban on assault weapons, and progressive tax reform. She gained a national profile for her pointed questioning of Trump administration officials during Senate hearings, including Trump's second Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault.[8]Harris sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, but withdrew from the race prior to the primaries. Joe Biden selected her as his running mate and their ticket went on to defeat the incumbent president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence, in the 2020 election. Harris became vice president upon being inaugurated on January 20, 2021 alongside President Joe Biden.Kamala Devi Harris was born in Oakland, California,[9] on October 20, 1964.[10] Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a Tamil Indian biologist, whose work on the progesterone receptor gene stimulated advances in breast cancer research,[11] had arrived in the United States from India in 1958 as a 19-year-old graduate student in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley;[12][13] Gopalan received her PhD in 1964.[14] Harris's father, Donald J. Harris, a Stanford University professor emeritus of economics, arrived in the United States from British Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study at UC Berkeley, receiving a PhD in economics in 1966.[15][16] Of Afro-Jamaican descent, Donald Harris met his future wife Shyamala Gopalan through the civil rights movement.[17][18]Harris and her younger sister Maya lived in Berkeley, California, during and after her parents' studies.[19][20] They stayed briefly on Milvia Street in central Berkeley, then at a duplex on Bancroft Way in West Berkeley, an area often called the \"flatlands\"[21] with a significant black population.[22] When Harris began kindergarten, she was bused as part of Berkeley's comprehensive desegregation program to Thousand Oaks Elementary School, a public school in a more prosperous neighborhood in northern Berkeley[21] which previously had been 95 percent white, and after the desegregation plan went into effect became 40 percent Black.[22]A neighbor regularly took the Harris girls to an African American church in Oakland where they sang in the children's choir,[23][24] and the girls and their mother also frequently visited a nearby African American cultural center.[25] Their mother introduced them to Hinduism and took them to a nearby Hindu temple, where she occasionally sang.[26] As children, she and her sister visited their mother's family in Madras (now Chennai) several times.[27] She says she has been strongly influenced by her maternal grandfather P. V. Gopalan, a retired Indian civil servant whose progressive views on democracy and women's rights impressed her. Harris has remained in touch with her Indian aunts and uncles throughout her adult life.[28] Harris has also visited her father's family in Jamaica.[29]Her parents divorced when she was seven. Harris has said that when she and her sister visited their father in Palo Alto on weekends, other children in the neighborhood were not allowed to play with them because they were black.[27]\nWhen she was twelve, Harris and her sister moved with their mother to Montreal, Quebec, where Shyamala had accepted a research and teaching position at the McGill University-affiliated Jewish General Hospital.[30] Harris attended a French-speaking primary school, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges,[31] then F.A.C.E. School,[32] and finally Westmount High School[b] in Westmount, Quebec, graduating in 1981.[34] Wanda Kagan, a high school friend of Harris, later told CBC News in 2020 that Harris was her best friend and described how she confided in Harris that Kagan had been molested by her stepfather.[35] She said that Harris told her mother, who then insisted Kagan come to live with them for the remainder of her final year of high school. Kagan said Harris had recently told her that their friendship, and playing a role in countering Kagan's exploitation, helped form the commitment Harris felt in protecting women and children as a prosecutor. After high school, in 1982, Harris attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. While at Howard, she interned as a mailroom clerk for California senator Alan Cranston, chaired the economics society, led the debate team, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.[36][37] Harris graduated from Howard in 1986 with a degree in political science and economics.[38]Harris then returned to California to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law through its Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP).[39] While at UC Hastings, she served as president of its chapter of the Black Law Students Association.[40] She graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1989[41] and was admitted to the California Bar in June 1990.[42]In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, where she was described as \"an able prosecutor on the way up\".[43] In 1994, Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown, who was then dating Harris, appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later to the California Medical Assistance Commission.[43] Harris took a six-month leave of absence in 1994 from her duties, then afterward resumed as prosecutor during the years she sat on the boards. Harris's connection to Brown was noted in media reportage as part of a pattern of Californian political leaders appointing \"friends and loyal political soldiers\" to lucrative positions on the commissions. Harris has defended her work.[43][44][45]In February 1998, San Francisco district attorney Terence Hallinan recruited Harris as an assistant district attorney.[46] There, she became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys, where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery, and sexual assault cases\u00a0\u2013 particularly three-strikes cases. In 2000, Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's assistant, Darrell Salomon,[47] over Proposition\u00a021, which granted prosecutors the option of trying juvenile defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts.[48] Harris campaigned against the measure, which passed. Salomon opposed directing media inquiries about Prop\u00a021 to Harris and reassigned her, a de facto demotion. Harris filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.[49]In August 2000, Harris took a job at San Francisco City Hall, working for city attorney Louise Renne.[50] Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and neglect cases. Renne endorsed Harris during her D.A. campaign.[51]In 2001, she briefly dated Montel Williams. Addressing the relationship, Williams tweeted in 2020, \"Kamala Harris and I briefly dated about 20 years ago when we were both single. So what? I have great respect for Sen. Harris\".[52]In 2002, Harris prepared to run for District Attorney of San Francisco against Hallinan (the incumbent) and Bill Fazio.[53]\nHarris was the least-known of the three candidates[54] but persuaded the Central Committee to withhold its endorsement from Hallinan.[51] Harris and Hallinan advanced to the general election runoff with 33 and 37 percent of the vote, respectively.[55]In the runoff, Harris pledged never to seek the death penalty and to prosecute three-strike offenders only in cases of violent felonies.[56] Harris ran a \"forceful\" campaign, assisted by former mayor Willie Brown, Senator Dianne Feinstein, writer and cartoonist Aaron McGruder, and comedians Eddie Griffin and Chris Rock.[57][58] Harris differentiated herself from Hallinan by attacking his performance.[59] She argued that she left his office because it was technologically inept, emphasizing his 52-percent conviction rate for serious crimes despite an 83-percent average conviction rate statewide.[60] Harris charged that his office was not doing enough to stem the city's gun violence, particularly in poor neighborhoods like Bayview and the Tenderloin, and attacked his willingness to accept plea bargains in cases of domestic violence.[61][62] Harris won with 56 percent of the vote, becoming the first person of color elected as district attorney of San Francisco.[63]Harris ran unopposed for a second term in November 2007.[64]In the summer of 2005, Harris created an environmental crimes unit.[65]In 2007, Harris and city attorney Dennis Herrera investigated San Francisco supervisor Ed Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position;[66] Harris charged Jew with nine felonies, alleging that he had lied under oath and falsified documents to make it appear he resided in a Sunset District home, necessary so he could run for supervisor in the 4th district.[67] Jew pleaded guilty in October 2008 to unrelated federal corruption charges (mail fraud, soliciting a bribe, and extortion)[67]\nand pleaded guilty the following month in state court to a charge of perjury for lying about his address on nomination forms, as part of a plea agreement in which the other state charges were dropped and Jew agreed to never again hold elected office in California.[68] Harris described the case as \"about protecting the integrity of our political process, which is part of the core of our democracy\".[68]\nFor his federal offenses, Jew was sentenced to 64 months in federal prison and a $10,000 fine;[69] for the state perjury conviction, Jew was sentenced to one year in county jail, three years' probation, and about $2,000 in fines.[70]Under Harris, the D.A.'s office obtained more than 1,900 convictions for marijuana offenses, including persons simultaneously convicted of marijuana offenses and more serious crimes.[71] The rate at which Harris's office prosecuted marijuana crimes was higher than the rate under Hallinan, but the number of defendants sentenced to state prison for such offenses was substantially lower.[71]\nProsecutions for low-level marijuana offenses were rare under Harris, and her office had a policy of not pursuing jail time for marijuana possession offenses.[71]\nHarris's successor as D.A., George Gasc\u00f3n, expunged all San Francisco marijuana offenses going back to 1975.[71]In the early 2000s, the San Francisco murder rate per capita outpaced the national average. Within the first six months of taking office, Harris cleared 27 of 74 backlogged homicide cases by settling 14 by plea bargain and taking 11 to trial; of those trials, nine ended with convictions and two with hung juries. She took 49 violent crime cases to trial and secured 36 convictions.[72] From 2004 to 2006, Harris achieved an 87-percent conviction rate for homicides and a 90-percent conviction rate for all felony gun violations.[73]Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. SFPD officers credited Harris with tightening the loopholes defendants had used in the past.[74] In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possessed or used assault weapons and would seek maximum penalties on gun-related crimes.[75]Harris created a Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools.[76] In early 2006, Gwen Araujo, a 17-year-old American Latina transgender teenager, was murdered by two men who later used the \"gay panic defense\" before being convicted of second-degree murder. Harris, alongside Araujo's mother Sylvia Guerrero, convened a two-day conference of at least 200 prosecutors and law enforcement officials nationwide to discuss strategies to counter such legal defenses.[77] Harris subsequently supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, advocating that California's penal code include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion in making their decision, also making mandatory for district attorney's offices in California to educate prosecutors about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.[78]\nIn September 2006, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed A.B. 1160 into law; the law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a lesser included offense on the basis of appeals to \"societal bias\".[78][79]In August 2007, state assemblyman Mark Leno introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the Cow Palace, joined by Harris, police chief Heather Fong, and mayor Gavin Newsom. City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco. (Earlier that month Newsom had signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property.) Leno alleged that merchants drove through the public housing developments nearby and illegally sold weapons to residents.[80] While the bill would stall, local opposition to the shows continued until the Cow Palace Board of Directors in 2019 voted to approve a statement banning all future gun shows.[81]Harris has said life imprisonment without parole is a better and more cost-effective punishment than the death penalty,[82] and has estimated that the resultant cost savings could pay for a thousand additional police officers in San Francisco alone.[82]During her campaign, Harris pledged never to seek the death penalty.[56]\nAfter a San Francisco Police Department officer, Isaac Espinoza, was shot and killed in 2004, U.S. senator (and former San Francisco mayor) Dianne Feinstein,[83] U.S. senator Barbara Boxer, Oakland mayor Jerry Brown, and the San Francisco Police Officers Association pressured Harris to reverse that position, but she did not.[84] (Polls found that seventy percent of voters supported Harris's decision.)[85] When Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member, was accused of murdering a man and his two sons in 2009,[86] Harris sought a sentence of life in prison without parole, a decision Mayor Gavin Newsom backed.[87]In 2004, Harris recruited civil rights activist Lateefah Simon to create the San Francisco Reentry Division.[88] The flagship program was the Back on Track initiative, a first-of-its-kind reentry program for first-time nonviolent offenders aged 18\u201330.[89] Initiative participants whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a twelve- to eighteen-month period. The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a high-school-equivalency diploma, maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests. At graduation, the court would dismiss the case and expunge the graduate's record.[90] Over six years, the 200 people graduated from the program had a recidivism rate of less than ten percent, compared to the 53 percent of California's drug offenders who returned to prison within two years of release. Back on Track earned recognition from the U.S. Department of Justice as a model for reentry programs. The DOJ found that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ($5,000) than the cost of adjudicating a case ($10,000) and housing a low-level offender ($50,000).[91] In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, A.B. 750) was enacted, encouraging other California counties to start similar programs.[92][93]\nAdopted by the National District Attorneys Association as a model, prosecutor offices in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Atlanta have used Back on Track as a template for their own programs.[94][95][96]In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city's skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort to combat truancy for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco.[97] Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris's office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant elementary students; penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.[98] The program was controversial when introduced.In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least fifty days of school, the first time San Francisco prosecuted adults for student truancy. San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, said the path from truancy to prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the D.A.'s office and social service agencies to create \"parental responsibility plans\" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.[99] By April 2009, 1,330 elementary school students were habitual or chronic truants, down 23 percent from 1,730 in 2008, and down from 2,517 in 2007 and from 2,856 in 2006.[100] Harris's office prosecuted seven parents in three years, with none jailed.[100]Nearly two years before the 2010 election, Harris announced she planned to run.[101] She also stated she would run only if then-Attorney General Jerry Brown did not seek re-election for that position.[102] Brown instead chose to run for governor and Harris consolidated support from prominent California Democrats.[103] Both of California's senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, and mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa all endorsed her during the Democratic primary.[103] In the June 8, 2010 primary, she was nominated with 33.6 percent of the vote, defeating Alberto Torrico and Chris Kelly.[104]In the general election, she faced Republican Los Angeles County district attorney Steve Cooley, who led most of the race.[105][106] Cooley ran as a nonpartisan,[107]distancing himself from Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman's campaign.[citation needed] The election was held November\u00a02 but after a protracted period of counting mail-in and provisional ballots, Cooley conceded on November 25.[108] Harris was sworn in on January 3, 2011; she is the first woman, the first African American, and the first South Asian American to hold the office of Attorney General in the state's history.[109]Harris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014 and filed paperwork to run on February 12.[110] The Sacramento Bee,[111] Los Angeles Daily News,[112] and Los Angeles Times endorsed her for re-election.[113]On November 4, 2014, Harris was re-elected against Republican Ronald Gold, winning 57.5 percent of the vote to 42.5 percent.[114]In 2011, Harris announced the creation of the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force in the wake of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis.[115] That same year, Harris obtained two of the largest recoveries in the history of California's False Claims Act\u00a0\u2013 $241\u00a0million from Quest Diagnostics and then $323\u00a0million from the SCAN healthcare network\u00a0\u2013 over excess state Medi-Cal and federal Medicare payments.[116][117]In 2012, Harris leveraged California's economic clout to obtain better terms in the National Mortgage Settlement against the nation's five largest mortgage servicers\u00a0\u2013 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Bank.[118] The mortgage firms were accused of illegally foreclosing on homeowners. After dismissing an initial offer of $2\u20134\u00a0billion in relief for Californians, Harris withdrew from negotiations. The offer eventually was increased to $18.4\u00a0billion in debt relief and $2\u00a0billion in other financial assistance for California homeowners.[119][120]Harris worked with Assembly speaker John P\u00e9rez and Senate president pro tem Darrell Steinberg in 2013 to introduce the Homeowner Bill of Rights, considered one of the strongest protections nationwide against aggressive foreclosure tactics.[121] The Homeowner Bill of Rights banned the practices of \"dual-tracking\" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and robo-signing and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution.[122] Harris achieved multiple nine-figure settlements for California homeowners under the bill mostly for robo-signing and dual-track abuses, as well as prosecuting instances in which loan processors failed to promptly credit mortgage payments, miscalculated interest rates, and charged borrowers improper fees. Harris secured hundreds of millions in relief, including $268\u00a0million from Ocwen Financial Corporation, $470\u00a0million from HSBC, and $550\u00a0million from SunTrust Banks.[123][124][125]From 2013 to 2015, Harris pursued financial recoveries for California's public employee and teacher's pensions, CalPERS and CalSTRS against various financial giants for misrepresentation in the sale of mortgage-backed securities. She secured multiple nine-figure recoveries for the state pensions, recovering about $193\u00a0million from Citigroup, $210\u00a0million from S&P, $300\u00a0million from JP Morgan Chase, and over half a billion from Bank of America.[126][127][128][129]In 2013, Harris declined to authorize a civil complaint drafted by state investigators who accused OneWest Bank, owned by an investment group headed by future U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin (then a private citizen), of \"widespread violation\" of California foreclosure laws.[130] During the 2016 elections, Harris was the only Democratic Senate candidate to receive a donation from Mnuchin. Harris was criticized for accepting the donation because Mnuchin purportedly profited from the subprime mortgage crisis through OneWest Bank;[131] she later voted against his confirmation as treasury secretary in February 2017. In 2019, Harris's campaign stated that the decision not to pursue prosecution hinged on the state's inability to subpoena OneWest. Her spokesman said, \"There was no question OneWest conducted predatory lending, and Senator Harris believes they should be punished. Unfortunately, the law was squarely on their side and they were shielded from state subpoenas because they're a federal bank.\"[132]In 2014, Harris settled charges she had brought against rent-to-own retailer Aaron's, Inc. on allegations of incorrect late charges, overcharging customers who paid off their contracts before the due date, and privacy violations. In the settlement, the retailer refunded $28.4\u00a0million to California customers and paid $3.4\u00a0million in civil penalties.[133]In 2015, Harris obtained a $1.2\u00a0billion judgment against for-profit post-secondary education company Corinthian Colleges for false advertising and deceptive marketing targeting vulnerable, low-income students and misrepresenting job placement rates to students, investors, and accreditation agencies.[134] The Court ordered Corinthian to pay $820\u00a0million in restitution and another $350\u00a0million in civil penalties.[135] That same year, Harris also secured a $60\u00a0million settlement with JP Morgan Chase to resolve allegations of illegal debt collection with respect to credit card customers, with the bank also agreeing to change practices that violated California consumer protection laws by collecting incorrect amounts, selling bad credit card debt, and running a debt-collection mill that \"robo-signed\" court documents without first reviewing the files as it rushed to obtain judgments and wage garnishments. As part of the settlement, the bank was required to stop attempting to collect on more than 528,000 customer accounts.[136]In 2015, Harris opened an investigation of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison regarding the closure of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. California state investigators searched the home of California utility regulator Michael Peevey and found handwritten notes that allegedly showed he had met with an Edison executive in Poland, where the two had negotiated the terms of the San Onofre settlement, leaving San Diego taxpayers with a $3.3\u00a0billion bill to pay for the closure of the plant. The investigation was closed amidst Harris's 2016 run for the U.S. Senate position.[137][138]In February 2012, Harris announced an agreement with Apple, Amazon, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and Research in Motion to mandate that apps sold in their stores display prominent privacy policies informing users of what private information they were sharing, and with whom.[139] Facebook later joined the agreement. That summer, Harris announced the creation of a Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit to enforce laws related to cyber privacy, identity theft, and data breaches.[140] Later the same year, Harris notified a hundred mobile-app developers of their non-compliance with state privacy laws and asked them to create privacy policies or face a $2,500 fine each time a non-compliant app is downloaded by a resident of California.[141]In 2015, Harris secured two settlements with Comcast, one totaling $33\u00a0million over allegations that it posted online the names, phone numbers and addresses of tens of thousands of customers who had paid for unlisted voice over internet protocol (VOIP) phone service and another $26\u00a0million settlement to resolve allegations that it discarded paper records without first omitting or redacting private customer information.[142][143] Harris also settled with Houzz over allegations that the company recorded phone calls without notifying customers or employees. Houzz was forced to pay $175,000, destroy the recorded calls, and hire a chief privacy officer, the first time such a provision has been included in a settlement with the California Department of Justice.[144]In November 2013, Harris launched the California Department of Justice's Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry in partnership with district attorney offices in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Alameda County.[145] In March 2015, Harris announced the creation of a pilot program in coordination with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department called \"Back on Track LA\". Like Back on Track, first time, non-violent, non-sexual, offenders aged between 18 and 30[failed verification] \u2013 90 men participated in the pilot program for 24\u201330 months. Assigned a case manager, participants received education through a partnership with the Los Angeles Community College District and job training services.[146]Harris's record on wrongful conviction cases as attorney general has engendered criticism from academics and activists.[147] Law professor Lara Bazelon contends Harris \"weaponized technicalities to keep wrongfully convicted people behind bars rather than allow them new trials\".[147] After the 2011 United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Plata declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal supervision, explaining \"I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client.\"[148] Harris declined to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives Prop\u00a036 (2012) and Prop\u00a047 (2014), arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.[148] John Van de Kamp, a predecessor as attorney general, publicly disagreed with the rationale.[148]In September 2014, Harris's office argued unsuccessfully in a court filing against the early release of prisoners, citing the need for inmate firefighting labor. When the memo provoked headlines, Harris spoke out against it, saying she was unaware that her office had produced the memo.[149] Since the 1940s, qualified California inmates have the option of volunteering to receive comprehensive training from the Cal Fire in exchange for sentence reductions and more comfortable prison accommodations; prison firefighters receive about $2 a day, and another $1 when battling fires.[150]In 2008, California voters passed Prop\u00a08, a state constitutional amendment providing that only marriages \"between a man and a woman\" are valid. Legal challenges were made by opponents soon after its approval, and a pair of same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in federal court in the case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger (later Hollingsworth v. Perry). In their 2010 campaigns, California attorney general Jerry Brown and Harris both pledged to not defend Prop\u00a08.[151]After being elected, Harris declared her office would not defend the marriage ban, leaving the task to Prop\u00a08's proponents.[152] In February 2013, Harris filed an amicus curiae brief, arguing Prop\u00a08 was unconstitutional and that the initiative's sponsors did not have legal standing to represent California's interests by defending the law in federal court.[153] In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled, 5\u20134, that Prop\u00a08's proponents lacked standing to defend it in federal court.[154] The next day Harris delivered a speech in downtown Los Angeles urging the Ninth Circuit to lift the stay banning same-sex marriages as soon as possible.[155] The stay was lifted two days later.[156]In 2014, Attorney General Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation to ban the gay and trans panic defense in court,[157] which passed and California became the first state with such legislation.[158]In February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender inmate at California's Mule Creek State Prison, filed a federal lawsuit based on the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary sex reassignment surgery (SRS).[159] In April 2015, a federal judge ordered the state to provide Norsworthy with SRS, finding that prison officials had been \"deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need\".[160][161] Harris, representing CDCR, appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,[162] arguing that psychotherapy,[163] as well as the hormone therapy Norsworthy had been receiving for her gender dysphoria over the preceding fourteen years, were sufficient medical treatment,[164] and there was \"no evidence that Norsworthy is in serious, immediate physical or emotional danger\".[164] While Harris defended the state's position in court, she said she ultimately pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to change their policy.[165] In August 2015, while the state's appeal was pending, Norsworthy was released on parole, obviating the state's duty to provide her with inmate medical care[166] and rendering the case moot.[167] In 2019, Harris stated that she took \"full responsibility\" for briefs her office filed in Norsworthy's case and others involving access to gender-affirming surgery for trans inmates.[168]In 2011, Harris urged criminal penalties for parents of truant children as she did as District Attorney of San Francisco, allowing the court to defer judgment if the parent agreed to a mediation period to get their child back in school. Critics charged that local prosecutors implementing her directives were overzealous in their enforcement and Harris's policy adversely affected families.[169] In 2013, Harris issued a report titled \"In School + On Track\", which found that more than 250,000 elementary school students in the state were \"chronically absent\" and the statewide truancy rate for elementary students in the 2012\u20132013 school year was nearly thirty percent, at a cost of nearly $1.4\u00a0billion to school districts, since funding is based on attendance rates.[170]Harris prioritized environmental protection as attorney general, first securing a $44\u00a0million settlement to resolve all damages and costs associated with the Cosco Busan oil spill, in which a container ship collided with San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled 50,000\u00a0gallons of bunker fuel into the San Francisco Bay.[171] In the aftermath of the 2015 Refugio oil spill, which deposited about 140,000\u00a0gallons of crude oil off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, Harris toured the coastline and directed her office's resources and attorneys to investigate possible criminal violations.[172] Thereafter, operator Plains All American Pipeline was indicted on 46 criminal charges related to the spill, with one employee indicted on three criminal charges.[173] In 2019, a Santa Barbara jury returned a verdict finding Plains guilty of failing to properly maintain its pipeline and another eight misdemeanor charges; they were sentenced to pay over $3\u00a0million in fines and assessments.[174]From 2015 to 2016, Harris secured multiple multi-million-dollar settlements with fuel service companies Chevron, BP, ARCO, Phillips 66, and ConocoPhillips to resolve allegations they failed to properly monitor the hazardous materials in its underground storage tanks used to store gasoline for retail sale at hundreds of California gas stations.[175][176][177] In summer 2016, automaker Volkswagen AG agreed to pay up to $14.7\u00a0billion to settle a raft of claims related to so-called Defeat Devices used to cheat emissions standards on its diesel cars while actually emitting up to forty times the levels of harmful nitrogen oxides allowed under state and federal law.[178] Harris and the chair of the California Air Resources Board, Mary D. Nichols, announced that California would receive $1.18\u00a0billion as well as another $86\u00a0million paid to the state of California in civil penalties.[178]California's Prop 69 (2004) required law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes. In 2012, Harris announced that the California Department of Justice had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within thirty days. Accordingly, Harris reported that the Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services had cleared California's DNA backlog for the first time).[179] Harris's office was later awarded a $1.6\u00a0million grant from the Manhattan District Attorney's initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested rape kits.[180]In 2015, Harris conducted a 90-day review of implicit bias in policing and police use of deadly force. In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind \"Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias\" training, designed in conjunction with Stanford University psychologist and professor Jennifer Eberhardt, to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the community. All Command-level staff received the training. The training was part of a package of reforms introduced within the California Department of Justice, which also included additional resources deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents, an expanded role for the department to investigate officer-related shooting investigations and community policing.[181] The same year, Harris's California Department of Justice became the first statewide agency in the country to require all its police officers to wear body cameras.[182] Harris also announced a new state law requiring every law enforcement agency in California to collect, report, and publish expanded statistics on how many people are shot, seriously injured or killed by peace officers throughout the state.[183]Later that year, Harris appealed a judge's order to take over the prosecution of a high-profile mass murder case and to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County district attorney's office over allegations of misconduct by Republican D.A. Tony Rackauckas. Rackauckas was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.[184] Harris noted that it was unnecessary to ban all 250 prosecutors from working on the case, as only a few had been directly involved, later promising a narrower criminal investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected.[185]In 2016, Harris announced a patterns and practices investigation into purported civil rights violations and use of excessive force by the two largest law enforcement agencies in Kern County, California, the Bakersfield Police Department and the Kern County Sheriff's Department.[186] Labeled the \"deadliest police departments in America\" in a five-part Guardian expose, a separate investigation commissioned by the ACLU and submitted to the California Department of Justice corroborated reports of police using excessive force.[187]In 2016, Harris's office seized videos and other information from the apartment of an antiabortion activist who had made secret recordings and then accused Planned Parenthood doctors of illegally selling fetal tissue. Harris had announced that her office would investigate the activist in the summer of 2015. She was facing increasing criticism for not taking public action by the time Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the activist.[188][189]In 2011, Harris obtained a guilty plea and a four-year prison sentence from a stalker who used Facebook and social engineering techniques to illegally access the private photographs of women whose social media accounts he hijacked. Harris commented that the Internet had \"opened up a new frontier for crime\".[190] Later that year, Harris created the eCrime Unit within the California Department of Justice, a 20-attorney unit targeting technology crimes.[191] In 2015, several purveyors of so-called revenge porn sites based in California were arrested, charged with felonies, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.[192][193] In the first prosecution of its kind in the United States, Kevin Bollaert was convicted on 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion and sentenced to 18 years in prison.[194] Harris brought up these cases when California Congresswoman Katie Hill was targeted for similar cyber exploitation by her ex-husband and forced to resign in late 2019.[195]In 2016, Harris announced the arrest of Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. The warrant alleged that 99 percent of Backpage's revenue was directly attributable to prostitution-related ads, many of which involved victims of sex trafficking, including children under the age of 18.[196] The pimping charge against Ferrer was dismissed by the California courts in 2016 on the grounds of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but in 2018, Ferrer pleaded guilty in California to money laundering and agreed to give evidence against the former co-owners of Backpage.[197] Ferrer simultaneously pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution in Texas state court and Arizona federal court.[197][198] Under pressure, Backpage announced that it was removing its adult section from all its U.S. sites.[199] Harris welcomed the move, saying, \"I look forward to them shutting down completely.\"[200] The investigations continued after she became a senator, and, in April 2018, Backpage and affiliated sites were seized by federal law enforcement.[198]During her term as attorney general, Harris's office oversaw major investigations and prosecutions targeting transnational criminal organizations for their involvement in violent crime, fraud schemes, drug trafficking, and smuggling. Significant arrests and seizures (of weapons, drugs, cash, and other assets) under Harris targeted the Tijuana Cartel (2011),[201] the Nuestra Familia, Norte\u00f1os, and the Vagos Motorcycle Club (2011),[202][203][204] the Norte\u00f1os (2015),[205][206] the Crips (2015),[207] the Mexican Mafia (2016),[208] and businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District accused of operating a major money-laundering hub for Mexican narcotics traffickers (2014).[209]In summer 2012, Harris signed an accord with the Attorney General of Mexico, Marisela Morales, to improve coordination of law enforcement resources targeting transnational gangs engaging in the sale and trafficking of human beings across the San Ysidro border crossing. The accord called for closer integration on investigations between offices and sharing best practices.[210] In 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law two bills advanced by Harris to combat human trafficking.[211] In November, Harris presented a report titled \"The State of Human Trafficking in California 2012\" at a symposium attended by U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and Attorney General Morales, outlining the growing prevalence of human trafficking in the state, and highlighting the involvement of transnational gangs in the practice.[212][213]In early 2014, Harris issued a report titled, \"Gangs Beyond Borders: California and the Fight Against Transnational Crime\",[214] addressing the prominent role of drug, weapons, and human trafficking, money laundering, and technology crimes employed by various drug cartels from Mexico, Armenian Power, 18th Street Gang, and MS-13 and offering recommendations for state and local law enforcement to combat the criminal activity.[215] Later that year, Harris led a bipartisan delegation of state attorneys general to Mexico City to discuss transnational crime with Mexican prosecutors.[216] Harris then convened a summit focused on the use of technology to fight transnational organized crime with state and federal officials from the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador.[217]After more than 20 years as a U.S. Senator from California, Senator Barbara Boxer announced in January 2015 that she would not run for reelection in 2016.[218] Harris announced her candidacy for the Senate seat the following week.[218] Harris was a top contender from the beginning of her campaign.[219]The 2016 California Senate election used California's new top-two primary format where the top two candidates in the primary would advance to the general election regardless of party.[219] In February 2016, Harris won 78% of the California Democratic Party vote at the party convention, allowing Harris's campaign to receive financial support from the party.[220] Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.[221] In the June 7 primary, Harris came in first with 40% of the vote and won with pluralities in most counties.[222] Harris faced congresswoman and fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez in the general election.[223] It was the first time a Republican did not appear in a general election for the Senate since California began directly electing senators in 1914.[224]On July 19, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.[225] In the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez, capturing over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.[226] Following her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and announced her intention to remain Attorney General through the end of 2016.[227][228]On January 28, after Trump signed Executive Order 13769, barring citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for ninety days, she condemned the order and was one of many to describe it as a \"Muslim ban\".[229] She called White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly at home to gather information and push back against the executive order.[230]In February, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education[231] and Jeff Sessions for United States Attorney General.[232] In early March, she called on Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.[233]In April, Harris voted against the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.[234] Later that month, Harris took her first foreign trip to the Middle East, visiting California troops stationed in Iraq and the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the largest camp for Syrian refugees.[235]In June, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[236] The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness. A week later, she questioned Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, on the same topic.[237] Sessions said her questioning \"makes me nervous\".[238] Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestions in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.[239]In December, Harris called for the resignation of Senator Al Franken, asserting on Twitter, \"Sexual harassment and misconduct should not be allowed by anyone and should not occur anywhere.\"[240]In January, Harris was appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee after the resignation of Al Franken.[242] Later that month, Harris questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for favoring Norwegian immigrants over others and claiming to be unaware that Norway is a predominantly white country.[243][244]In May, Harris heatedly questioned Secretary Nielsen about the Trump administration family separation policy, under which children were separated from their families when the parents were taken into custody for illegally entering the U.S.[245] In June, after visiting one of the detention facilities near the border in San Diego,[246] Harris became the first senator to demand Nielsen's resignation.[247]In the September and October Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris questioned Brett Kavanaugh about a meeting he may have had regarding the Mueller Investigation with a member of Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by the President's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz. Kavanaugh was unable to answer and repeatedly deflected.[248] Harris also participated in questioning the FBI director's limited scope of the investigation on Kavanaugh regarding allegations of sexual assault.[249] She voted against his confirmation.Harris was a target of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts.[250]In December, the Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act (S. 3178), sponsored by Harris.[251] The bill, which died in the House, would have made lynching a federal hate crime.[252]In March 2019, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Harris called for U.S. Attorney General William Barr to testify before Congress in the interests of transparency.[253] Two days later, Barr released a four-page \"summary\" of the redacted Mueller Report, which was criticized as a deliberate mischaracterization of its conclusions.[254] Later that month, Harris was one of twelve Democratic senators to sign a letter led by Mazie Hirono questioning Barr's decision to offer \"his own conclusion that the President's conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice\" and called for an investigation into whether Barr's summary of the Mueller Report and his statements at a news conference were misleading.[255]On May 1, 2019, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[256] During the hearing, Barr remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he had released ahead of the full report.[257] When asked by Harris if he had reviewed the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge the President with obstruction of justice, Barr admitted that neither he, Rod Rosenstein, nor anyone in his office reviewed the evidence supporting the report before making the charging decision.[258] Harris later called for Barr to resign, and accused him of refusing to answer her questions because he could open himself up to perjury, and stating his responses disqualified him from serving as U.S. attorney general.[259][260] Two days later, Harris demanded again that the Department of Justice inspector general Michael E. Horowitz investigate whether Attorney General Barr acceded to pressure from the White House to investigate Trump's political enemies.[261]On May 5, 2019, Harris said \"voter suppression\" prevented Democrats Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum from winning the 2018 gubernatorial elections in Georgia and Florida; Abrams lost by 55,000 votes and Gillum lost by 32,000 votes. According to election law expert Richard L. Hasen, \"I have seen no good evidence that the suppressive effects of strict voting and registration laws affected the outcome of the governor's races in Georgia and Florida.\"[262]In July, Harris teamed with Kirsten Gillibrand to urge the Trump administration to investigate the allegations of Uyghur genocide by the Chinese Communist Party; in this question she was joined by colleague Marco Rubio.[263]In November, Harris called for an investigation into the death of Roxsana Hern\u00e1ndez, a transgender woman and immigrant who died in ICE custody.[264][265]In December, Harris led a group of Democratic senators and civil rights organizations in demanding the removal of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller after emails published by the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed frequent promotion of white nationalist literature to Breitbart website editors.[266]Before the opening of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump on January 16, 2020, Harris delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate, stating her views on the integrity of the American justice system and the principle that nobody, including an incumbent president, is above the law. Harris later asked Senate Judiciary chairman Lindsey Graham to halt all judicial nominations during the impeachment trial, to which Graham acquiesced.[267][268] Harris voted to convict the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[269]Harris has worked on bipartisan bills with Republican co-sponsors, including a bail reform bill with Senator Rand Paul,[270] an election security bill with Senator James Lankford,[271] and a workplace harassment bill with Senator Lisa Murkowski.[272]Following her election as Vice President of the United States, Harris resigned from her seat on January 18, 2021,[273] prior to taking office on January 20, 2021, and was replaced by California Secretary of State Alex Padilla.[274]While in the Senate, Harris was a member of the following committees:[275]Harris had been considered a top contender and potential frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.[279] In June 2018, she was quoted as \"not ruling it out\".[280] In July 2018, it was announced that she would publish a memoir, a sign of a possible run.[281] On January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her candidacy for president of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.[282] In the first 24\u00a0hours after her candidacy announcement, she tied a record set by Bernie Sanders in 2016 for the most donations raised in the day following an announcement.[283][284] More than 20,000\u00a0people attended her formal campaign launch event in her hometown of Oakland, California, on January 27, according to a police estimate.[285]During the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for \"hurtful\" remarks he made, speaking fondly of senators who opposed integration efforts in the 1970s and working with them to oppose mandatory school bussing.[286] Harris's support rose by between six and nine points in polls following that debate.[287] In the second debate in August, Harris was confronted by Biden and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard over her record as attorney general.[288] The San Jose Mercury News assessed that some of Gabbard's and Biden's accusations were on point, such as blocking the DNA testing of a death row inmate, while others did not stand up to scrutiny. In the immediate aftermath, Harris fell in the polls following that debate.[289][290] Over the next few months her poll numbers fell to the low single digits.[291] At a time when liberals were increasingly concerned about the excesses of the criminal justice system, Harris faced criticism from reformers for tough-on-crime policies she pursued while she was California's attorney general. For example, in 2014, she decided to defend California's death penalty in court.[292]Prior to and during her presidential campaign an online informal organization using the hashtag #KHive formed to support her candidacy and defend her from racist and sexist attacks.[293][294][295][296] According to the Daily Dot, Joy Reid first used the term in an August 2017 tweet saying \"@DrJasonJohnson @ZerlinaMaxwell and I had a meeting and decided it's called the K-Hive.\"[297]On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, citing a shortage of funds.[298] In March 2020, Harris endorsed Joe Biden for president.[299]In May 2019, senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed the idea of a Biden\u2013Harris ticket.[300] In late February, Biden won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary with the endorsement of House whip Jim Clyburn, with more victories on Super Tuesday. In early March, Clyburn suggested Biden choose a black woman as a running mate, commenting that \"African American women needed to be rewarded for their loyalty\".[301] In March, Biden committed to choosing a woman for his running mate.[302]On April 17, 2020, Harris responded to media speculation and said she \"would be honored\" to be Biden's running mate.[303] In late May, in relation to the murder of George Floyd and ensuing protests and demonstrations, Biden faced renewed calls to select a black woman to be his running mate, highlighting the law enforcement credentials of Harris and Val Demings.[304]On June 12, The New York Times reported that Harris was emerging as the frontrunner to be Biden's running mate, as she was the only African American woman with the political experience typical of vice presidents.[305] On June 26, CNN reported that more than a dozen people close to the Biden search process considered Harris one of Biden's top four contenders, along with Elizabeth Warren, Val Demings, and Keisha Lance Bottoms.[306]On August 11, 2020, Biden announced that he had chosen Harris. She was the first African American, the first Indian American, and the third woman after Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin to be picked as the vice-presidential nominee for a major party ticket.[307]Harris became the vice president\u2013elect following the Biden-Harris ticket's victory in the 2020 United States presidential election.[308] After the major networks called the election for Biden/Harris, Harris was recorded calling Biden, saying, \"We did it! We did it, Joe. You're going to be the next President of the United States.\" The quote became one of the top 10 tweets of 2020.[309]Following the election of Joe Biden as U.S. president in the 2020 election, Harris assumed office as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[310] She is the United States' first female vice president, the highest-ranking female elected official in U.S. history, and the first African-American and first Asian-American vice president.[311][312] She is also the second person of color to hold the post, preceded by Charles Curtis, a Native American and member of the Kaw Nation, who served under Herbert Hoover from 1929 to 1933.[313] She is the third person with acknowledged non-European ancestry to reach one of the highest offices in the executive branch, after Curtis and former president Barack Obama.Harris resigned her Senate seat on January 18, 2021, two days before her swearing-in as vice president. Her first act as vice president was swearing in her replacement Alex Padilla and Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who were elected in the 2021 Georgia runoff elections.[314]Since January 20, 2021, the current 117th Congress's Senate has been divided 50\u201350 between Republicans and Democrats;[315] this meant that Harris had to be frequently called upon to cast tiebreaking votes. Harris cast her first of two tie-breaking votes on February 5, 2021. In February and March, Harris's tie-breaking votes in her role as President of the Senate were crucial in passing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package proposed by President Biden since no Republicans in the Senate voted for the package.[316][317] On July 20, 2021, Harris broke Mike Pence's record for tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency[318] when she cast the seventh tie-breaking vote in her first six months.[319] As of November 2021, Harris has cast 13 tie-breaking votes during her first year in office, the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing John Adams who cast 12 votes in 1790.[319][320]In a debunked story by the New York Post in April 2021, it was claimed that Harris's children's book Superheroes Are Everywhere was being distributed en masse through \"welcome kits\" given to migrant children at a shelter in Long Beach, California.[321] In reality, only a single copy of the book had been donated by a member of the public. The writer of the original story, Laura Italiano, claimed that she was forced to write the story against her will and she resigned from the New York Post as a result.[322]In April 2021, Harris indicated that she was the last person in the room before President Biden decided to remove all U.S. troops from Afghanistan and commented that the president has \"an extraordinary amount of courage\" and \"make(s) decisions based on what he truly believes ... is the right thing to do.\"[323] National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Biden \"insists she be in every core decision-making meeting. She weighs in during those meetings, often providing unique perspectives.\"[324]On March 24, 2021, Biden tasked Harris to reduce the number of unaccompanied minors and adult asylum seekers. She is also tasked with leading the negotiations with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.[325] Harris conducted her first international trip as vice president in June 2021, visiting Guatemala and Mexico in an attempt to address the root causes of an increase in migration from Central America to the United States.[326] During her visit, in a joint press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris issued an appeal to potential migrants, stating \"I want to be clear to folks in the region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come.\"[327] Her work in Central America led to creation of task forces on corruption and human trafficking; a women's empowerment program, and an investment fund for housing and businesses.[324]Harris met with French President Emmanuel Macron in November 2021 to strengthen ties after the cancellation of a submarine program.[328]Nearing ten months in office, approval ratings for the president and the vice president were 38% and 28%, respectively.[329]On November 19, 2021, Harris served as acting president from 10:10 to 11:35 am EST, while President Biden underwent a colonoscopy.[330] She became the first woman, and the third person overall, to assume the powers and duties of the U.S. presidency under Section\u00a03 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment.[331][332]Harris's term in office has seen high staff turnovers that included her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, press secretary, deputy press secretary, communications director, and chief speechwriter. Her critics suggest such reports are typical of her abrasive management style.[333]In 2005, the National Black Prosecutors Association awarded Harris the Thurgood Marshall Award. That year, she was included in a Newsweek report profiling \"20 of America's Most Powerful Women\".[334] A 2008 New York Times article published later that year also identified her as a woman with potential to become president of the United States, highlighting her reputation as a \"tough fighter\".[335]In 2013, 2020, and 2021, Time included Harris on the Time 100, Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[336][337][338] In 2016, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center awarded Harris the Bipartisan Justice Award along with Senator Tim Scott.[339] Biden and Harris were jointly named Time Person of the Year for 2020.[340]Harris was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[341]Harris met her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, through a mutual friend who set up Harris and Emhoff on a blind date in 2013.[347] Emhoff was an entertainment lawyer who became partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.[347][348] Harris and Emhoff were married on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California.[349] Harris is a stepmother to Emhoff's two children, Cole and Ella, from his previous marriage to the film producer Kerstin Emhoff.[350] As of August 2019, Harris and her husband had an estimated net worth of $5.8\u00a0million.[351]Harris is a multiracial American[311] and a Baptist, holding membership of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, a congregation of the American Baptist Churches USA.[352][353][354][355] She is a member of The Links.[356][357]Harris's sister, Maya, is a lawyer and MSNBC political analyst; her brother-in-law, Tony West, is general counsel of Uber and a former United States Department of Justice senior official.[358] Her niece, Meena, is the founder of the Phenomenal Women Action Campaign and former head of strategy and leadership at Uber.[359]Harris is well known for her distinctive wearing of pearl necklaces. Although speculation during the 2020 presidential campaign emerged that she began wearing them as an homage to her Howard University sorority,[360][361][362] or even to Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, known for wearing a distinctive collar when issuing a dissent in the court,[361] in her 2019 biography The Truths We Hold Harris explained that she began doing so after being given a pearl necklace as a gift by her mother's mentor Howard.[363]Harris has written two non-fiction books and one children's book.",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Chief_Medical_Advisor_to_the_President": "The Chief Medical Advisor to the President is a position within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The position was established in 2019 during the Trump administration. On December 4, 2020, it was announced that Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would serve in the role in the Biden administration.[1][2][3][4][5]On February 2, 2019, former physician to the president Ronny Jackson was selected to serve as chief medical advisor and assistant to President Donald Trump.[6] In the role, Jackson's job included advising Trump on public health policy.[7] Jackson left the White House Office at the end of 2019, and the position was vacant through 2020. In the Biden administration, Fauci continues to advise on public health policy related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[8]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Anthony_Fauci": "Anthony Stephen Fauci OMRI (/\u02c8fa\u028at\u0283i/; born December 24, 1940) is an American physician-scientist and immunologist serving as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President.As a physician with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fauci has served the American public health sector in various capacities for more than fifty years and has acted as an advisor to every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan.[1] He has been director of the NIAID since 1984 and has made contributions to HIV/AIDS research and other immunodeficiency diseases, both as a research scientist and as the head of the NIAID.[2] From 1983 to 2002, Fauci was one of the world's most frequently cited scientists across all scientific journals.[2][3] In 2008, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, for his work on the AIDS relief program PEPFAR.[4]During the COVID-19 pandemic, he served under President Donald Trump as one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fauci's advice was frequently contradicted by Trump, and Trump's supporters alleged that Fauci was trying to politically undermine Trump's run for reelection. Some falsely claimed he was involved in creating the virus in a Chinese lab.[5][6][7] After Joe Biden took office, Fauci began serving as one of the lead members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team and as Biden's chief medical advisor.[8][9]Anthony Fauci was born on December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Eugenia Lillian (n\u00e9e Abys; 1909\u20131965) and Stephen A. Fauci (1910\u20132008). His father was a Columbia University-educated pharmacist who owned his own pharmacy. Fauci's mother and sister worked the pharmacy's register and Fauci delivered prescriptions. The pharmacy was located in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, directly beneath the family apartment, previously in the Bensonhurst neighborhood.[10]Fauci's grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy in the late 19th century. His paternal grandparents, Antonino Fauci and Calogera Guardino, were from Sciacca, and his maternal grandparents were from Naples. His maternal grandmother Raffaella Trematerra was a seamstress, and his maternal grandfather Giovanni Abys was a Swiss-born artist noted for his landscape and portrait painting, magazine illustrations in Italy, as well as graphic design for commercial labels, including olive oil cans. Fauci grew up Catholic,[10][11] but now considers himself a humanist, stating that he thinks \"that there are a lot of things about organized religion that are unfortunate, and [that he tends] to like to stay away from it.\"[12] In 2021, he was named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.[13]Fauci attended Regis High School, a private Jesuit school in Manhattan's Upper East Side, where he captained the school's basketball team despite standing only 5\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (1.70\u00a0m) tall.[14][15][2] After graduating in 1958, Fauci attended the College of the Holy Cross, graduating in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics with a pre-med track. Fauci then attended Cornell University's Medical College (now Weill Cornell Medicine), graduating with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1966 ranked first in his class.[10] He then did an internship and residency in internal medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (now Weill Cornell Medical Center).[2]After completing his medical residency in 1968, Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a clinical associate in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases's (NIAID) Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI).[16] He became head of the LCI's Clinical Physiology Section in 1974, and in 1980 was appointed chief of the NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation. He became director of the NIAID in 1984, a position he still holds.[17] Fauci has been offered the position of director of the NIH several times, but has declined each time.[18]Fauci has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to contend with viral diseases like HIV/AIDS, SARS, the Swine flu, MERS, Ebola, and COVID-19. He played a significant role in the early 2000s in creating the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)[19] and in driving development of biodefense drugs and vaccines following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.[20]Fauci has been a visiting professor at many medical centers and has received numerous honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S. and abroad.[21]Fauci has made important scientific observations that contributed to the understanding of the regulation of the human immune response and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby immunosuppressive agents adapt to that response. He developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey, members of the American Rheumatism Association ranked Fauci's work on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis as one of the most important advances in patient management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.[21][22][23]Fauci has contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body's natural defense system, progressing to AIDS. He has outlined the mechanisms of induction of HIV expression by endogenous cytokines.[23] Fauci has worked to develop strategies for the therapy and immune reconstitution of patients with the disease, as well as for a vaccine to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV.In 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information stated that from 1983 to 2002, \"Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 to 3.0 million authors in all disciplines throughout the world who published articles in scientific journals.\"[2] As a government scientist under seven presidents, Fauci has been described as \"a consistent spokesperson for science, a person who more than any other figure has brokered a generational peace\" between the two worlds of science and politics.[14]In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, Fauci remarked, \"My career and my identity has really been defined by HIV.\"[24] He was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s.[25] In 1981, he and his team of researchers began looking for a vaccine or treatment for this novel virus, though they would meet a number of obstacles.[26] In October 1988, protesters came to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute's director in 1984, bore the brunt of the anger from the LGBTQ+ community who were largely ignored by the government.[27][28]Leading AIDS activist Larry Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media.[29] He called him an \"incompetent idiot\" and a \"pill-pushing\" tool of the medical establishment. Fauci did not have control over drug approval though many people felt he was not doing enough. Fauci did make an effort in the late 1980s to reach out to the LGBTQ+ community in New York and San Francisco to find ways he and the NIAID could find a solution.[27] Though Fauci was initially admonished for his treatment of the AIDS epidemic, his work in the community was eventually acknowledged. Kramer, who had spent years hating Fauci for his treatment of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, eventually called him \"the only true and great hero\" among government officials during the AIDS crisis.[30][27]In 2014, Sean Strub of HuffPost criticized Fauci for \"delaying promotion of an AIDS treatment that would have prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the first years of the epidemic\" and accused him of \"rewriting history.\"[31]Political commentator Helen Andrews defended Fauci's actions during the epidemic in a 2021 article, writing:The idea that Fauci was \"wrong\" about A.I.D.S., which some of his contemporary opponents repeat, is unfair. His most notorious error was a 1983 paper suggesting \"routine close contact, as within a family household,\" might spread the disease, but it was an understandable mistake given what was known at the time and he corrected it within a year, lightning speed by the standards of academic publishing. He behaved more responsibly than some of his peers when it came to speculating about a heterosexual A.I.D.S. epidemic around the corner. He was not one of the hysteria-mongers\u2014though he did benefit from the hysteria when negotiating budgets with Congress.[32]In a meeting with reporters on September 17, 2009, Fauci predicted that the H1N1 virus causing the 2009 swine flu pandemic could infect as many as one in three Americans, more than the amount of Americans usually infected by the seasonal flu.[33]On October 16, 2014, in a United States congressional hearing regarding the Ebola virus crisis, Fauci, who, as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had been discussing the importance of screening for weeks,[34] testified that NIAID was still some distance away from producing sufficient quantities of cures or vaccines for widespread trials.[35] Specifically, Fauci said, \"While NIAID is an active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is important to recognize that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented.\"[35]Fauci also remarked in the hearing: \"As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement is essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers, and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end.\"[35]Fauci was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force established in late January 2020, under President Donald Trump, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[36][37] He became a de facto public health spokesperson for the office of the president during the pandemic,[38][39] and a strong advocate for ongoing social distancing efforts in the United States.[40]In interviews on January 21, January 26, and February 17, Fauci commented on COVID-19. He said that at the time of the interviews (\"right now\"), COVID-19 was not a \"major threat\" to the American public, with the risk to the American public being \"low\", but that it was \"an evolving situation\", and that \"public health officials need to take [COVID-19] very seriously\".[41][42] In the latter interview, Fauci said that COVID-19 could become a \"global pandemic which would then have significant implications for\" the United States.[42]In March 2020, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.[43][44]In a March 8, 2020, interview, Fauci stated that \"right now in the United States, people [who are not infected] should not be walking around with masks\", but \"if you want to do it, that's fine\".[45][46] In the same interview, Fauci said that buying masks \"could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need\" them: \"When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them\".[45][47] When Fauci made this comment, America's top surgical mask maker was struggling to produce enough masks to meet the increased demand.[47] On April 3, the CDC reversed course, quoting recent studies that showed asymptomatic transmission of the virus, thus advocating for the public to wear non-surgical masks to reduce community transmission, while Fauci advocated for wearing facial coverings in public.[46]In mid-April, when asked about social distancing and stay-at-home measures, Fauci said that if the administration had \"started mitigation earlier\" more lives could have been saved, and \"no one is going to deny that.\" He added that the decision-making for implementing mitigation measures was \"complicated\", and \"there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\"[48]Fauci's comments were met with a hostile response from former Republican congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine. Trump retweeted Lorraine's response, which included the call to \"#FireFauci\", drawing public alarm. \"Fire Fauci\" has also been chanted by anti-lockdown protesters in various locations, including Florida and Texas.[49] As a result, the White House denied that Trump was firing Fauci, and blamed the media for overreacting.[50][51]Due to Trump's opposition to CDC mask wearing guidelines and social distancing measures, which Fauci advocated, Fauci was  criticized by right-wing pundits and received death threats that necessitated a security detail.[52][53][54] In an interview with 60 Minutes in 2020, he mentioned that other members of his family, including his wife and daughters, had been repeatedly harassed since the pandemic began.[55]In June 2020, Fauci said that he was \"very concerned\" that the ongoing protests against police brutality would cause \"surges\" in COVID-19 cases, stating that the \"large crowds\" are a \"perfect set-up\" for the virus to spread.[56] In July 2020, Fauci advised the public to \"avoid crowds of any type\".[57]On July 6, 2020, Fauci spoke on a Facebook livestream, offering his opinion that the country's situation pertaining to COVID-19 \"is really not good\", pointing to more than 55,000 new cases on July 4, 2020. He said the United States was \"still knee-deep in the first wave\" of cases, and was experiencing a \"resurgence of infections\".[58] On July 7, 2020, during a press conference, Fauci stated that it was a \"false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death\" for COVID-19 in the country: \"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.\" Both Trump and the White House had cited the falling death rate as proof of success of the Trump administration's response.[59] After this appearance by Fauci, the White House cancelled three media appearances that had been scheduled for him later that week.[60] On July 7, 2020, Trump contradicted Fauci's comments describing a dire situation in the country, with Trump saying: \"I think we are in a good place. I disagree with [Fauci].\"[61] While there were disagreements, Trump also at times praised Fauci.[62][63][64]On July 9, 2020, Trump publicly claimed that Fauci \"made a lot of mistakes\".[60][65][66] By July 12, 2020, a White House official told media outlets that \"several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\", passing to the media a list of purported mistakes made by Fauci during the outbreak.[60][65] One of the supposed mistakes highlighted was Fauci's February 29, 2020, statement in an interview that \"at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day-by-day basis.\" However, the White House list neglected to mention that in that same interview, Fauci had stated that the risk could change, \"when you start to see community spread\", and that the disease could morph into \"a major outbreak\" in the country.[67]As late as September 23, 2020, when U.S. coronavirus fatalities exceeded 200,000, conservatives continued to question Fauci's and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendations for responding to the pandemic. In a hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee,[68] Kentucky's Senator Rand Paul asked him if he had \"second thoughts\" about his mitigation recommendations, including keeping six feet of distance from others and mask-wearing, claiming, \"our death rate is essentially worse than Sweden's.\" Fauci stood by the guidelines, indicating Sweden's fatality rate exceeded those of other Scandinavian countries, and said the comparison between Sweden and the U.S. was not legitimate. Fauci said the recommendations remained valid. After Paul then asserted New York's high fatality rate showed that mitigation efforts were insufficient, Fauci replied, \"You've misconstrued that, Senator, and you've done that repetitively in the past.\" Fauci explained further that New York State had succeeded in getting the virus under control by following the CDC's clinical guidelines.[69] Paul had made numerous claims about herd immunity, Sweden's interventions to combat the pandemic, the contention that the populations of Asian countries have greater resilience against COVID-19, and statements about death rates due to the virus.[68]In October 2020, Fauci objected after his words \"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more\" were featured in an advertisement from the Trump campaign touting Trump's handling of the pandemic. Fauci said he did not consent to the ad, his words were taken out of context (he was actually referring to how hard the Coronavirus Task Force was working),[70] and he had never made a political endorsement in his career.[71]On October 18, 2020, Fauci mentioned that he \"wasn't surprised\" Donald Trump contracted COVID-19.[55] The next day, during a presidential call, Trump called Fauci \"a disaster\" and said that \"people are tired of COVID.\"[72] During a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 19, Trump launched attacks on his political rival Joe Biden, saying that Biden \"wants to listen to Dr. Fauci\" regarding the handling of the pandemic, upon which Biden merely replied \"Yes\" on Twitter.[73] On October 31, The Washington Post published an extensive interview with Fauci, in which he voiced a candid assessment of the administration's COVID-19 policies and was critical of the influence of presidential advisor Scott Atlas.[74]Shortly after midnight on November 2, 2020, Trump insinuated he would fire Fauci \"after the election\" while on stage at a campaign rally at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Opa-locka, Florida. At the rally, he made false claims that the pandemic was \"rounding the turn\" and was met by audience chants of \"Fire Fauci!\", to which he responded \"Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until after the election\u00a0... I appreciate the advice.\"[75][76] Despite the rhetoric, Fauci was not fired.On December 2, the United Kingdom became the first western country to license a vaccine against the coronavirus (Pfizer-BioNTech). In response, Fauci said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was proceeding \"the correct way\"[77] and said the U.K. \"really rushed through that approval\".[78] The next day Fauci apologized, telling the BBC \"I have a great deal of confidence in what the U.K. does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the U.K.\u00a0... I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way.\"[79]On January 3, 2021, President Trump tweeted, \"The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of [the CDC's] ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries\".[80] That same morning, Fauci responded in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, \"The numbers are real. We have well over 300,000 deaths. We are averaging two- to three thousand deaths per day. All you need to do\u00a0... is go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.\"[81]When asked if the 2021 United States Capitol attack was a COVID-19 superspreader event, Fauci stated: \"I think for those people there, they probably put themselves at an increased risk because they essentially did not adhere to the fundamentals of public health and COVID-19 context which is universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds in congregate settings. The fact that it was outdoors is a little bit better than if they were indoors completely. But you can still have a super spreader situation when you do things in a crowded way.\"[82]On January 23, 2021, Fauci was quoted saying that letting the science speak on the pandemic got him \"into a little bit of trouble\" and got \"push-back from people in the White House, including the president\", during the Trump administration. Fauci was also reportedly blocked from appearing on The Rachel Maddow Show for some time because the Trump administration \"didn't like the way [Maddow handles] things and they didn't want me on [the show].\"[83]On December 3, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden asked Fauci, in addition to remaining in his role as director of the NIAID, to serve as the chief medical advisor to the president in the Biden administration.[84][85] Fauci accepted the offer.[86]After the inauguration of Joe Biden in January 2021, Fauci said he experienced a \"liberating feeling\" in being able to speak freely about science without interference from the new administration. He pictured Biden's administration as committed to being \"completely transparent, open and honest\".[87] In early April 2021, Fauci said of the current situation in the United States that \"It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase\".[88]In early May 2021, when asked if the CDC's summer camp guidance was excessive, Fauci responded by saying that \"I wouldn't call them excessive, but they certainly are conservative\" and added that the guidance \"looks a bit strict\" and \"a bit stringent\".[89] Also in early May, Fauci said that he is \"not convinced\" that COVID-19 originated naturally and that \"we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened\".[90] In mid-May 2021, Fauci said that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks outdoors, except for in \"completely crowded situations\".[91] This guidance was updated in July 2021 to recommend that all people wear masks regardless of vaccination status, in what Fauci said was due to the much more contagious Delta variant.[92]In May 2021, Fauci denied that the National Institutes of Health supported \"gain-of-function research\" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.[94]In early June 2021, over 3,000 internal government emails sent by Fauci from January to June 2020 were obtained by media outlets through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These emails contain information about how the United States and Fauci initially responded to COVID-19.[95][96]On June 22, 2021, Fauci said that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the \"greatest threat\" to eliminating COVID-19 in the United States.[97]In December 2021, Fauci, along with virologist Jeffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens endorsed the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, advocating in favor of \"an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full \"universe\" of existing and emerging coronaviruses.\"[98][99][100]In February 2022, Fauci told the Financial Times that \"As we get out of the full-blown pandemic phase of Covid-19, which we are certainly heading out of, these decisions will increasingly be made on a local level rather than centrally decided or mandated. There will also be more people making their own decisions on how they want to deal with the virus.\"[101]In March 2022, Fauci said that the United States should expect an increase in COVID-19 cases from the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, but that it might not lead to a severe increase in hospitalizations and deaths.[102]Owing to his prominent role in the United States response to numerous global pandemics, most notably HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, Fauci has become the subject of tributes and interpretations across various media, including television, literature, merchandising, and internet memes.[103][104] Brad Pitt's performance as Fauci during the 2020 season of Saturday Night Live earned the actor an Emmy nomination, and praise from Fauci.[105] Author Sally Quinn has credited Fauci as the inspiration for the love interest to the protagonist in her bestselling 1991 romance novel Happy Endings.[106] Larry Kramer based the character Dr. Anthony Della Vida on Fauci in his play The Destiny of Me.[107]In the spring of 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, bakeries across the United States began selling pastries, particularly donuts, with Fauci's face on them to pay tribute to his work in the public health sector.[108]In September 2021, Fauci, a documentary film about Fauci's life and career, was released by Magnolia Pictures.[109] The film was produced by National Geographic Documentary Films.[110]In 1985, Fauci married Christine Grady, a nurse and bioethicist with the NIH, after they met while treating a patient.[111] Grady is chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.[59] Together they have three adult daughters.[112]Fauci is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Philosophical Society,[113] and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, as well as other numerous professional societies including the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Association of Immunologists. He serves on the editorial boards of many scientific journals, as an editor of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, and as an author, coauthor, or editor of more than 1,000 scientific publications, including several textbooks.[114] On March 23, 2021, Fauci was admitted as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.[115]In addition to receiving an honorary degree in 2015, Fauci was invited to deliver guest remarks on May 21, 2020, for the Johns Hopkins University Class of 2020.[150] Other notable guest speakers during the virtual ceremony included Reddit co-founder and commencement speaker Alexis Ohanian; and philanthropist and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.[151] The College of the Holy Cross announced that its science complex would be renamed the Anthony S. Fauci Integrated Science Complex on June 11, 2022.[152]",
    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/CNN": "The Cable News Network (CNN) is a multinational news-based pay television channel headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.[2][3][4] It is owned by CNN Global, which is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.[5] It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel.[6][7][8] Upon its launch in 1980, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage[9] and the first all-news television channel in the United States.[10]As of September 2018, CNN had 90.1 million television households as subscribers (97.7% of households with cable).[11] According to Nielsen, in June 2021 CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks.[12] While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019,[13][14] then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year),[15] it settled back to number 11 in 2021.[16]The network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic. CNN claims to be \"The Most Trusted Name in News\",[17] but its efforts to be nonpartisan have led to accusations of false balance.[23]Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories;[24] since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, some islands of the Caribbean and in Japan, where it was first broadcast on CNNj in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.[25]The Cable News Network was launched at 5:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast.[26] Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN at its launch, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw.[27]Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television providers, several websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (11 domestic, 31 international),[28] more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource),[29] and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world.[30] The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner[31] and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.[32]A companion channel, CNN2, was launched on January 1, 1982[33] and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts.[34] The channel, which later became known as CNN Headline News and is now known as simply HLN, eventually focused on live news coverage supplemented by personality-based programs during the evening and primetime hours.CNN+ (CNN Plus) was a Spanish language 24-hour television news channel that was launched in 1999 as a joint venture by Sogecable and Turner Broadcasting. It went off the air at the end of December 28, 2010. The management announced that CNN+ would be closed on December 31, 2010.[35]The Gulf War in 1990\u20131991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the \"Big Three\" American networks in viewership for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside Iraq during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad by reporters Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett.[36]The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Shaw on January 16, 1991, as follows:[37]This is Bernie Shaw. Something is happening outside. ... Peter Arnett, join me here. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing... The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. ... We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky.Unable to immediately broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic feel of a radio broadcast \u2013 and was compared[by whom?] to CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's live radio reports of the German bombing of London during World War II.[38] Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.[39]The Gulf War coverage brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy, and made household names of previously obscure reporters. Shaw, known for his live-from-Bagdhad reporting during the Gulf War, became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001.[40][41] Others include then\u2013Pentagon correspondent Wolf Blitzer (now host of The Situation Room since August 8, 2005) and international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn as ruthless reporter Adriana Cruz in the 1999 film Three Kings. Time Warner\u2013owned sister network HBO later produced a television movie, Live from Baghdad, about CNN's coverage of the first Gulf War.[42]Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s (particularly the infamous Battle of Mogadishu) led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term \"the CNN effect\" to describe the perceived impact of real time, 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the American government.[43]CNN was the first cable news channel to break the news of the September 11 attacks.[44] Anchor Carol Lin was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time that morning and said:This just in. You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the World Trade Center, and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. CNN Center right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center.Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air.[45] He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN's New York City bureau, and reported that a commercial jet had hit the Trade Center.[46]Daryn Kagan and Leon Harris were live on the air just after 9:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time as the second plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent David Ensor, reported the news that U.S. officials determined \"that this is a terrorist act\".[47] Later, Aaron Brown and Judy Woodruff anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded, winning an Edward R. Murrow award for the network.[48] Brown had just joined CNN from ABC to serve as the breaking news anchor. CNN has made archival files of much of the day's broadcast available in five segments, plus an overview.Leading up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, CNN devoted large amounts of its coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons. On June 3 and 5, 2007, CNN teamed up with Saint Anselm College to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates.[49] Later that year, the channel hosted the first CNN/YouTube presidential debates, a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the YouTube video-sharing service.[50] In 2008, CNN partnered with the Los Angeles Times to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of Super Tuesday.[51] CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.[51]Driven by live coverage of the year's U.S. presidential election, 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history.[52] Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the Trump campaign rallies. Aides for Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz accused CNN President Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the Republican primaries.[53] After the election, Zucker acknowledged that it was a mistake to air so many of the campaign rallies.[54] CNN also drew criticism[55] during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.[56]The presidency of Donald Trump has led to many prominent controversies involving CNN. The network was accused by critics of giving disproportionate amounts of coverage to Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. CNN president Jeff Zucker defended CNN against the criticism, commenting that out of the Republican candidates, Trump was the most willing to give on-air interviews. Trump commented upon the allegations during his speech at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), jokingly referring to CNN as the \"Clinton News Network\".[57][58]In January 2017, CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on a classified dossier which detailed compromising personal and financial information allegedly obtained by the Russian government. While CNN did not publish the dossier, Trump criticized the network during a press conference the following day, and refused to take a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta, claiming that the network was \"fake news\".[59] On June 26, 2017, CNN investigative journalists Thomas Frank, Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris voluntarily resigned after the network retracted an online article which incorrectly connected Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and admitted that the online story did not meet their editorial standards.[60] Zucker responded by stressing that the network needs to \"play error-free ball\" when it comes to any future stories about Trump.[61]In July 2017, Trump posted a video on Twitter of himself tackling Vince McMahon on the ground during WrestleMania 23, edited to replace McMahon's face with the CNN logo. The clip was considered to be a further expression of his opinions regarding the network's quality of coverage. Several media columnists and Democratic politicians condemned the retweeted video, concerned that its substance\u2014given the tone of some of Trump's criticism of mainstream media outlets for what he deems as unfavorable coverage of him, and his presidency\u2014could encourage some of his extreme right-wing supporters to commit violence against journalists from outlets outside of the conservative media spectrum.[62][63] CNN also faced criticism[64] over an investigation that identified the Reddit user (associated with a Trump-focused community on the service, r/The_Donald) who had allegedly created the video, facing accusations that they had blackmailed the user.[65]Later that month, a group of Democratic senators, led by Amy Klobuchar, issued a request for information over allegations that the Trump administration was planning to use CNN as \"leverage for political gain\" in the process of clearing the proposed acquisition of its parent company Time Warner by AT&T\u2014a purchase which was first announced in October 2016.[66][67] The Daily Caller reported that, in particular, the administration was seeking the removal of Jeff Zucker as CNN president. Although Trump had promised to block the acquisition entirely during his presidential campaign, Trump's transition team later stated that the government planned to evaluate the deal without prejudice.[68][69][70][71]Following the announcement of the acquisition, AT&T CEO Randall L. Stephenson stated that the company was \"committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN\".[72] In August 2017, Deadline Hollywood reported that AT&T had considered spinning off CNN and its stake in TMZ post-acquisition.[72] In October 2017, Stephenson downplayed the possibility that the ongoing tensions between Trump and CNN could affect the deal, stating that he \"[didn't] know what the relevance of CNN is in terms of an antitrust review\", and that AT&T did not plan to make managerial changes to Time Warner properties that were operating well, such as CNN.[73] Later that month, CNN launched a new promotional campaign, \"Facts First\", in an effort to combat negative perceptions over the quality of its reporting. Using an apple to demonstrate metaphors for fake news and \"alternative facts\" (in particular, suggesting that one could persistently opine that the apple was actually a banana), the ads publicize a commitment to prioritizing accurate, fact-based reporting before presenting opinions on a particular story.[74][75] The ad became the subject of parodies, including one by The Daily Caller (which reversed the ad, and amended the slogan with \"unless we are reporting on Trump\"), and Stephen Colbert (which closed with the line \"Now orange you ready to impeach?\"), and was criticized by conservative publishers, Republican politicians, and on social media.[76][77][78][79]On November 6, 2017, Stephenson met with Makan Delrahim, assistant Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, to discuss antitrust and concentration of media ownership concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them.[80][81] Two days later, major media outlets publicly reported that the Justice Department had recommended that either the entire Turner Broadcasting System unit, or DirecTV, be divested as a condition of the merger. The Financial Times went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN.[82][83][80][84] Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN.[85][86] CNN's media correspondent Brian Stelter noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT&T's scale following the merger, or a retaliatory measure by the Trump administration against CNN.[80]At the DealBook conference in New York City the next day, Stephenson denied that the department had demanded the divestment of CNN at all (stating that he had \"never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN\"), and that the company aimed to \"get to a negotiated settlement\". However, he stated that if they were unable to do so, AT&T was \"prepared to litigate\".[87][80] In a statement to CNBC, a Department of Justice official backed Stephenson, denying that there were any specific demands to divest CNN during the discussion, and considering the claims to be \"shocking\" and an attempt to politicize the situation. The official added that the department had officially recommended either abandoning the deal entirely, or divesting DirecTV or Turner, but that it was open to other options for quelling antitrust concerns.[81] The same day, the watchdog group Protect Democracy sued the Department of Justice to seek information on whether the Trump administration had \"improperly interfered with the Department's review of the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, or has acted in that matter based on the President's personal dislike of CNN's protected speech.\" The group had issued a Freedom of Information Act request for these details, but the department had not responded.[88] On November 20, 2017, the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit over the acquisition.[89]After District of Columbia U.S. District Court judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T in the lawsuit, AT&T completed its acquisition of Time Warner on June 14, 2018, and renamed the company WarnerMedia.[90]In March 2019, WarnerMedia announced a reorganization that effectively dissolved Turner Broadcasting, and CNN became part of the new WarnerMedia News & Sports division. Jeff Zucker was named head of the new division, which added Turner Sports and the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks to his remit.[91]On May 6, 2019, CNN began to broadcast programming from its new studios at 30 Hudson Yards, which succeeded the Time Warner Center as the network's Manhattan headquarters.[92][93] Meanwhile, in late May 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, citing losses of $10 million per-year.[94]On May 29, 2020, the CNN Center became the scene of rioting in response to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, four days earlier. Rioters vandalized the CNN logo in the front of the building, broke most of the windows, threw objects at officers standing by in the lobby, and damaged Atlanta Police Department vehicles parked along the street before being cleared out by police officers in the early morning hours of May 30. Some of the protesters were arrested and were taken into the building, which houses a police precinct, this was why the rioters specifically targeted CNN Center. The damage was quickly repaired within the week.[95][96]In May 2021, AT&T announced that it would divest WarnerMedia, and that it would subsequently merge with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.[97][98][99]In July 2021, CNN announced it would launch a subscription streaming service, CNN+, in the United States during the first quarter of 2022, which would feature original programming and an on-demand library of CNN original series and documentaries.[100] In December 2021, the service hired long-time Fox News journalist Chris Wallace to host a program on the service.[101] The service would launch on March 28, 2022, shortly before the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger.[102]After a dismal launch (with CNBC estimating only around 10,000 average daily users),[103] CNN announced on April 21 that CNN+ would be shut down at the end of the month. Both Warner Bros. Discovery's head of Global Streaming & Interactive Entertainment J.B. Perrette, and new CNN head Chris Licht (who replaced the outgoing Jeff Zucker) stated that the service was incompatible with the company's goal of having a single streaming service to cover all of its brands\u2014which would include a future merger of Discovery+ and HBO Max. Perrette stated that the situation was \"avoidable\", but that the existing leadership (which were unable to discuss plans with Discovery's executives until the completion of the merger for legal restrictions) had went on with the launch despite the pending merger.[104][105]CNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs during the evening and prime time hours. The network's morning programming consists of Early Start, an early-morning news program hosted by Christine Romans and Laura Jarrett at 5\u20136 a.m. ET, which is followed by New Day, the network's morning show, hosted by John Berman and Brianna Keilar at 6\u20139 a.m. ET. Most of CNN's late-morning and early afternoon programming consists of CNN Newsroom, a rolling news program hosted by Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow in the morning and Ana Cabera, Victor Blackwell, and Alisyn Camerota in the afternoon. In between the editions of Newsroom, At This Hour with Kate Bolduan airs at 11 a.m. to noon Eastern, followed by Inside Politics with John King, hosted by John King at noon Eastern.[106]CNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of The Lead with Jake Tapper, hosted by Jake Tapper at 4-6 p.m. Eastern and The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, hosted by Wolf Blitzer at 6 p.m. ET. The network's evening and primetime lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including Erin Burnett OutFront at 7 p.m. ET,[107] and Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 at 8 p.m. ET, and Don Lemon Tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern.[citation needed]Weekend primetime - from 9pm ET - is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as documentary specials and miniseries, and documentary-style reality series (such as Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown and United Shades of America), as well as acquired documentary films presented under the banner CNN Films. The network's weekend morning programming consists of CNN Newsroom (simulcast from CNN International) at 4\u20136 a.m. ET, which is followed by the weekend editions of New Day, hosted by Christi Paul and Boris Sanchez, which airs every Saturday at 6\u20139 a.m. ET and Sunday at 6\u20138 a.m. ET, and the network's Saturday program Smerconish with Michael Smerconish at 9 a.m. Eastern. Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, including Inside Politics Sunday, hosted by Abby Phillip at 8 a.m. Eastern and State of the Union, co-hosted by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at noon Eastern[108] and the international affairs program Fareed Zakaria GPS, hosted by Fareed Zakaria at 10 a.m. Eastern and replay at 1 p.m. Eastern, and the media analysis program Reliable Sources, hosted by Brian Stelter at 11 a.m. Eastern. Weekend programming other than aforementioned slots is filled with CNN Newsroom by Fredricka Whitfield, Jim Acosta, Pamela Brown, and other rolling anchors.[citation needed]For the 2014\u201315 season, after cancelling Piers Morgan Tonight (which, itself, replaced the long-running Larry King Live), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00\u00a0p.m. ET hour, such as John Walsh's The Hunt, This Is Life with Lisa Ling, and Mike Rowe's Somebody's Gotta Do It. Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00\u00a0p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan \"Go there\".[109][110][111] In May 2014, CNN premiered The Sixties, a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades.[112][113][114][115] Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 was expanded to run two hours long, from 8 PM to 10 PM.[116]By 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off 1968), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and U.S. policies, such as The Bush Years, and American Dynasties: The Kennedys\u2014which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7 million viewers. Parts Unknown concluded after the 2018 death by suicide of its host Anthony Bourdain; CNN announced several new miniseries and docuseries for 2019, including American Style (a miniseries produced by the digital media company Vox Media),[117] The Redemption Project with Van Jones, Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta, Tricky Dick (a miniseries chronicling Richard Nixon), The Movies (a spin-off of the Hanks/Goetzman decades miniseries), and Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962-64.[118][119]CNN began broadcasting in the high-definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007.[120] This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.CNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.[121]In December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower-third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static \"flipper\", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or \"topical\" details related to a story.[122][123]CNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue and white color scheme, and moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen. Additionally, the network began to solely produce its programming in the 16:9 aspect ratio, with standard definition feeds using a letterboxed version of the HD feed.[123] On February 18, 2013, the \"flipper\" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker; originally displayed as a blue background with white text, the ticker was reconfigured a day later with blue text on a white background to match the look of the 'flipper'.[124]On August 11, 2014, CNN introduced a new graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from CNN Business, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor.[125] In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as \"CNN Sans\", across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums.[126]In August 2016, CNN announced the launch of CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR), a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.[127]On July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year.[128] In January 2013, former NBCUniversal President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.[129]On January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.[130]In February 2022, Zucker was asked to resign by Jason Kilar, the chief executive of CNN's owner WarnerMedia, after Zucker's relationship with one of his lieutenants was discovered during the investigation into former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo's efforts to control potentially damaging reporting regarding his brother Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York.[131][132] Kilar announced that the interim co-heads would be executive vice presidents Michael Bass, Amy Entelis, and Ken Jautz.[1]  On February 26, 2022, it was announced that Chris Licht\u2014known for his work at MSNBC and CBS\u2014would be the next president of CNN; he is planned to be instated after the spin off and merger of WarnerMedia into Discovery Inc.[133]CNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially known as CNN Interactive), on August 30, 1995.[134] The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.[citation needed]In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.[135]CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.[136]On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack.[137][138]The company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system.[139] The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver[140] covered, and was detained,[141] for the release of the U.S. Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK.[142] This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various prosumer and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.[citation needed]On October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new \"sign up\" option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new \"CNN Pulse\" (beta) feature, along with a new red color theme.[143] However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted.The topical news program Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.[144] Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room (Inside Politics later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.[citation needed]). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.[145]In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called \"Eatocracy,\" which will \"cover all news related to food \u2013 from recalls to health issues to culture\".[146] CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.[147]CNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers' questions online at CNN's \"The Chart\" blog website. Contributors include Drs. Sanjay Gupta (Chief Medical Correspondent), Charles Raison (Mental Health Expert), Otis Brawley (Conditions Expert), Melina Jampolis (Diet and Fitness Expert), Jennifer Shu (Living Well Expert), and Elizabeth Cohen (Senior Medical Correspondent).[148]In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium).[149] CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.CNN also has multiple channels in the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but those videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their television programming on TuneIn Radio.[150] The network also hosts CNN-10, a daily 10-minute video show visible at the CNN website or YouTube. It replaced the long-running show CNN Student News which had been aired since 1989.[151] It is aimed at a global audience of students, teachers, and adults, and is hosted by Carl Azuz.[152]On March 7, 2017, CNN announced the official launch of its virtual reality unit named CNNVR. It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital.[153][154] It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.[155]CNN Newsource is a subscription-based affiliation video service that provides CNN content to television station affiliates with CNN, including terrestrial stations and international stations. Newsource allows affiliates to download video from CNN, as well as from other affiliates who upload their video to Newsource.CNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire.[156]CNN's digital storefront, which sells branded merchandise, household goods, and software, is operated by StackCommerce via partnership.Starting in late 2010, the high definition feed of CNN US was launched in Japan for American viewers under the name \"CNN/US HD\",[157] and is distributed by Japan Cable Television (JCTV) to several different multi-channel TV providers, such as J:COM, SKY PerfecTV!, iTSCOM and the JCTVWiFi service.[158]On November 28, 2016, CNN announced the acquisition of Beme for a reported $25 million.[159] On November 29, 2016, Matt Hackett, co-founder of Beme, announced via an email to its users that the Beme app would be shutting down on January 31, 2017.[160] Since the shutdown of the app, it was announced that CNN intended to use the current talent behind Beme to work on a separate start-up endeavor. Beme's current team will retain full creative control of the new project, which was slated to release in summer 2017.[161] Beme have also brought on other internet stars such as the host of Vsauce 3, Jake Roper, as head of production, who features prominently in Beme co-founder Casey Neistat's vlogs.[162] Beme News has since begun uploading news related video on YouTube.[163]In October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled Girl Rising, a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls' education.[164]In July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. This service is unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their own news brands.[165]As of February 2019, the audio simulcast of CNN is distributed on Entercom's Radio.com website and app.[166]Over the years, CNN has launched spin-off networks in the United States and other countries. Channels that currently operate as of 2021[update] include:CNN has also launched television and online ventures that are no longer in operation, including:CNN launched two specialty news channels for the American market which would later close amid competitive pressure: the sports news channel CNNSI shut down in 2002, while business news channel CNNfn shut down after nine years on the air in December 2004. CNN had a partnership with Sports Illustrated through the sports website CNNSI.com, but sold the domain name in May 2015.[173] CNNfn's former website used to redirect to money.cnn.com, a product of CNN's strategic partnership with Money magazine. Money and Sports Illustrated were both Time Warner properties until 2014, when the company's magazine division was spun off into the separate Time Inc.[174]CNN also launched \"Great Big Story\" in November 2015 to produce content tailored toward younger viewers.  It was eventually shut down in September 2020[175] after building a following of nearly 6 million followers on both Facebook and YouTube.[176]CNN operates bureaus in the following cities as of November\u00a02021[update].[177]United StatesIn parts of the world without a CNN bureau, reports from local affiliate stations will be used to file a story.CNN has been involved in various controversies, criticisms and allegations since its inception in 1980.2021: CNN won a George Polk Award for Foreign Reporting for their reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and later under quarantine in Beijing.[178] CNN and Clarissa Ward were named finalists for the duPont-Columbia Award for their \"Russia\u2019s Secret Influence Campaigns\" investigation.[179]2020: CNN's Ed Lavandera was awarded a Peabody for \"The Hidden Workforce: Undocumented in America\".[180] CNN Films was awarded a Peabody for the documentary \"Apollo 11\".[180]2019: The USC Annenberg School awarded CNN with a Walter Cronkite Award for its Parkland Town Hall.[181]2018: CNN won a network-record six news & documentary Emmy Awards.

She is the founder and CEO of the cosmetics company Glossier and the blog Into the Gloss. She was featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2015.[1] In 2019, she was included in Time magazine's \"Next 100\".[2]Emily Weiss was raised in Wilton, Connecticut.[3] Her father worked as an executive at Pitney Bowes and her mother stayed at home.[3] In high school, Weiss interned at Ralph Lauren for two summers and briefly had a modeling career.[3][4]  While interning at Teen Vogue in college, she appeared on The Hills on a three-episode arc with Lauren Conrad and Whitney Port.[5] Weiss graduated from New York University in 2007 with a degree in studio art.[4] She was a fashion assistant at W magazine and an on-set styling assistant for Vogue where she assisted Elissa Santisi.[3]Weiss launched Into the Gloss, a blog featuring predominantly interviews with women, in September 2010.[4] She stayed at her day job at Vogue and worked on Into the Gloss in the mornings between the hours of 4\u00a0a.m. and 8\u00a0a.m.[4] A popular series on the blog is Top Shelf, where subjects are interviewed in their bathrooms and photos of their shelves and medicine cabinets are featured. Previous interviews include Jenna Lyons and Karlie Kloss.[3] By early 2012, the site had more than 200,000 unique visitors per month. By May 2016, the site garnered 1.3 million visitors.[6] After Weiss reached 10 million page views per month and acquired corporate partnerships for the site and a small staff, she quit her job at Vogue to focus on her business ventures full time.[4]In 2014, Weiss started approaching venture capitalists with ideas for expansion, including a potential Into the Gloss-curated e-commerce platform.[4] Weiss eventually raised $2 million in seed funding, with the help of venture capitalist Kirsten Green, the founder of San Francisco-based Forerunner Ventures.[7] Weiss used this initial investment to hire a small team and launch Glossier.com.[4]In October 2014, Weiss introduced Glossier's first four products on her Into the Gloss blog and announced the launch of Glossier.com.[4] The Glossier team launched the e-commerce site with an all-purpose balm, a facial mist, a sheer skin tint, and a moisturizer.[8][9]According to Polina Marinova of Fortune, Weiss, \"Quietly turned Glossier into one of the most disruptive brands in beauty.\"[10] She initially pitched the company to 12 firms, with 11 not interested.[11] In February 2018, Weiss released that Glossier had successfully raised an additional $52 million in a Series C round of funding.[12] In March 2019, Weiss announced that Glossier had officially raised $100 million in a Series D round of funding and was valued at $1.2 billion.[13][14] The round was led by Sequoia Capital and Glossier announced at this time that it more than doubled its revenue in 2018, adding over 1 million new customers.[15]Since its initial launch with four products, Glossier has expanded its product line to include skin serums, masks, shower gel, body lotion, fragrance, lip balms and several other beauty and skincare related items.[16][17]Glossier dropped GlossiWEAR on July 17, 2019.[18]In early 2019, Glossier added Glossier Play to its product umbrella. The line includes pigmented and metallic makeup products, such as eye shadows and eyeliners. In 2020, the company announced plans to suspend the line's production.[19] Weiss stated that launching a sub-brand was, in hindsight, unnecessary, \"The realisation we had was, 'Huh, we could have just launched more make-up products'.\"[19]Weiss is engaged to Will Gaybrick, a senior executive at Stripe.[20][21]The couple is also expecting a baby that's due in June 2022.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/Geena_Davis_Institute_on_Gender_in_Media": "The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is a US non-profit research organization that researches gender representation in media and advocates for equal representation of women. The institute is currently headquartered at Mount Saint Mary's University, in Los Angeles, California.[1]After watching children's TV with her young daughter, Geena Davis noticed that the large majority of these television shows and other media lacked a large number of female characters.[2][3][4] After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children's television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.[5][4] Davis studied 122 \"G, PG, and PG-13 films theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.\u201d [6] Generally, she found that \u201conly 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,\u201d and these women are more sexualized than the men.[6] As \u201cchildren are engaging with media up to 7\u201310 hours/day,\u201d the representation of women in children's television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves.[4] Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.[3]Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media.[7] Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the institute.[8]The institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry. The institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them.[9]Davis states, \"The fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias.\"[9]One of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood's sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, \"Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40's. If you look at IMDb, up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40's, I made one movie, Stuart Little.\"[10]The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years.The institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for-profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media.[11]In 2010, the institute, along with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.[12]The institute has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the institute has partnered with Ford and several YouTube stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between Ford and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured Taryn Southern, Yulin Kang, and Clara C.[13] The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks \u201cto fight unconscious gender bias in media.\u201d [13]\nThe institute has also teamed up with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls\u2019 Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women.[14] Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from Google. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the institute's research of on-screen gender disparities.[15]In addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the institute has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute's goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the United Nations; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.[16]The institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from 2008 and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the US film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families.[17]\nEach year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings.[3] Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public's attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of 2014 and 2015 and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films.[18] However, the study also found that \u201cwomen had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,\u201d and cites women such as Tina Fey and Melissa McCarthy as a couple of the year's leading women.[18] Yet even with female leads such as Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only \u201c11% featured a female lead.\u201d[18] Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, \u201cfilms led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.\u201d [18]In 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in films than ever before.[19] A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like The Hunger Games and Brave, both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of girls participating in archery greatly increased.[20] According to Davis, \u201c68% of the film companies they\u2019ve worked with have changed two or more of their projects\u201d to include more female representation.[21]In partnership with the Lyda Hill Foundation, the institute released a 2018 study of the media representation of female characters in the science, technology, engineering and math career fields. The study showed that men depicted 62.3% of all STEM characters, while women accounted for 37.1%.[22] In a survey of girls and young women, the majority of participants acknowledged the impact of female STEM characters in the media.[23] Particularly influential characters were April Sexton (Chicago Med), Addison Montgomery (Private Practice) and Temperance Brennan (Bones).[24] In addition, the study revealed that female STEM mentors as well as personal connections to female STEM professionals and supportiveness contribute to more girls choosing a career in the field.[25]In addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the Bentonville Film Festival with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood.[26] The yearly festival is held in Bentonville, Arkansas. Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival. The festival also has concerts with various artists each year. In 2018 country singers Carly Pearce and Lauren Alaina performed as well as Jillian Jacqueline, Vintage Troube and Fifth Harmony's Ally Brooke.[27][28]",

The standard certification awards given consist of Gold, Platinum, and sometimes Diamond awards, in ascending order; the UK also has a Silver certification, ranking below Gold. In most cases, a \"Multi-Platinum\" or \"Multi-Diamond\" award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements.Many music industries around the world are represented by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries.[1] In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.Though all certifying bodies give awards for album sales or shipments, many also certify singles, paid digital downloads, streaming media, music videos, music DVDs, and master ringtones. Additionally, some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins, varying genres, lengths, and formats.

    "https://en.m.wikipedia.org//wiki/ARIA_Charts": "The ARIA Charts (stylised as the AR1A CHARTS since November 2018) are the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling songs and albums in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the Kent Music Report, which had been Australia's national music sales charts since 1974.The Go-Set charts were Australia's first national singles and albums charts, published from 5 October 1966 until 24 August 1974. Succeeding Go-Set, the Kent Music Report began issuing the national top 100 charts in Australia from May 1974. The compiler, David Kent, also published Australia's national charts from 1940 to 1974 in a retrospective fashion using state-based data. In mid-1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association commenced licensing the Kent Music Report chart.[1] The first printed national top 50 chart available in record stores, branded the Countdown chart, was dated the week ending 10 July 1983.[2]ARIA began compiling its charts in-house from the chart survey dated 13 June 1988, corresponding with the printed top 50 charts dated the week ending 26 June 1988.[3] Various artists' compilation albums were initially included in the albums chart, as they had been on the Kent Report chart, until 2 July 1989, when a separate Compilations chart was created.[4] The ARIA Report, detailing the top 100 singles and albums charts, was first available via subscription in January 1990.[1] The printed top 50 charts ceased publication in June 1998,[5] but resumed publication later in the year. The printed top 50 charts again ceased publication at the end of 2000.[6]Since 17 February 1997, all physical sales data contributing towards the chart has been recorded electronically at point of sale.[6] In March 1991, \"Do the Bartman\" by The Simpsons was the first single to reach No. 1 in Australia that was not available on 7-inch vinyl, but cassingle only.[7]In April 2006, ARIA began publishing the Digital Tracks Chart, counting download sales data from providers such as iTunes and BigPond Music.[8][9] Starting from 9 October 2006, digital sales data was integrated into the singles chart alongside physical sales, although singles were required to have a physical release to be included.[10][11][12] From 5 November 2007, the eligibility rules were widened so that singles only available digitally could chart, and \"Apologize\" by Timbaland was the first single to enter the chart purely on digital sales.[13][14] In February 2008, \"Don't Stop the Music\" by Rihanna became the first single to reach number one on digital sales alone.[15]In May 2006, it was announced that the Brazin retailing group, comprising HMV, Sanity and Virgin Megastore outlets, would no longer contribute sales data to the ARIA charts.[16][17] However, after a five-month absence, Brazin reportedly re-commenced contributing sales figures on 26 November 2006.[18]On 10 December 2012, ARIA launched the Streaming Tracks Chart, tracking audio streaming data from services such as Spotify, and later Apple Music.[19][20] ARIA introduced streaming data into the singles chart on 24 November 2014,[21][22] and the albums chart on 15 May 2017.[23] In October 2018, ARIA changed the methodology to give greater emphasis to paid subscription streams over ad-supported streams.[24]On 15 March 2021, ARIA announced that as of the following Friday, they would be releasing weekly chart figures at 5pm AEST each Friday, replacing the previous method of releasing them each Saturday evening.[25]On 1 March 2022, the association announced that chart figures would incorporate YouTube streaming data from logged-in users from 4 March onwards.[26][27]The ARIA website publishes the top 50 singles and albums charts (truncated from the top 100), top 40 digital tracks chart (truncated from the top 50), and top 20 dance singles chart (truncated from the top 25). The ARIA Report lists all charts in full and is available via paid e-mail subscription each week. These reports are uploaded to the Pandora Archive periodically.[28]The top 50 singles and albums charts are also published by online industry magazine The Music Network, along with various other charts.[29]On 5 February 2006, the ARIA Chart Show was a radio program launched on the Nova network and broadcast throughout Australia, playing the official ARIA top 50 singles. The live music program was hosted by Jabba each Sunday afternoon at 3:00pm.[30]From 1 June 2013 to 3 September 2016, the Take 40 Australia radio program broadcast the official ARIA top 40 singles on Saturday afternoons, typically from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm, on each state's Hit Network-owned radio station.[31] The show was aired before the top 50 chart, dated for the following Monday, is published on the ARIA website at 6:00 pm.[31] The charts were previously published online at 6:00 pm each Sunday.[31]"
